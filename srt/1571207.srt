00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Okay, this is Concord Storytellers and today another special guest, friend, neighbor, scientist,

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,960
father, Micah Benson. Welcome. Hi CJ. Thanks for joining. Today we're going to talk about,

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,160
and we kind of pregame this, about talking about COVID-19 from the perspective of telling somebody

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,840
50 years from now about it. So what was it like going through that from a few different lenses,

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,360
one as a scientist, another as just a human locking down, another from the parent's perspective,

6
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,360
and we may find a couple others along the way. But even when we were just kind of previewing,

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,640
doing this episode together, it was amazing how many memories it kind of buried already

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
from four or five years ago. And so it's been interesting digging this back up, obviously a

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:21,840
pretty dark time in the world, a lot of unknowns that aren't all completely solved yet, but

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,120
something that would be interesting to talk about and you being an expert in the field,

11
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,120
I thought it would be really interesting to talk to you and bring that perspective in

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
and just talk about how you perceived it during the time that it was all going on. So welcome.

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,360
Could you just talk a bit about yourself and your career?

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,640
Yeah, absolutely. So thanks CJ and glad to be here. So first off, when I was thinking about this,

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,600
I realized that this was probably going to be the least viewed podcast, at least for individuals

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,880
within Concord today, in large part because no one wants to remember what happened in COVID.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Yeah. I think we've all collectively buried it. And at least for me, I don't pretend to be an

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,640
expert vaccinologist or epidemiologist, but what I am is an immunologist. So I trained

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,800
as a cellular immunologist, I did my PhD in it. I trained at Dartmouth, did a postdoc at Harvard,

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,960
and I think as it relates to my perspective during COVID, I actually did my PhD on humoral memory,

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,520
which is what happens when you encounter a pathogen, whether it's a virus or a bacteria,

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,160
your immune system recognizes it, and then it develops a immunological memory immune response.

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,640
And in particular, what I studied was one of the confounding questions that I think still persists

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,480
is why do memory responses against vaccines, against pathogens, stick around for the lifetime

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
of the individual? I think we now know that there's certainly a lot of nuance to that,

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,880
at least with COVID. One of the unfortunate things was that I think we learned kind of the hard way

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,080
that some of the durability of the vaccines kind of waned after six, nine months, which led to a

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,000
need for boosters. So there's certainly exceptions to that, but at least during my PhD, I studied,

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm going to identify some of the survival factors as to what keeps the cell type that produces

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,200
antibodies against pathogens alive. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I'll say,

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,440
I find myself surrounded by Dartmouth alums. Is there like some sort of thing there where you

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,160
move to Metro West, Massachusetts? Yeah. It's the trees.

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,640
Okay. Well, gotcha. Okay. Yeah. You get accustomed to it being in the New Hampshire and Northwoods.

34
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,920
And then you come to Boston and like a lot of people, you do your thing in the city,

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,760
then you slowly start getting that itch for trees and nature. And Dartmouth is a fantastic

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,640
destination to get that. And I would say there's actually a lot of similarities and feel between

37
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,920
downtown Concord as well as Hanover, where Dartmouth is. Cool. Yeah. I had similar vibes

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
looking out here from where I grew up in Tennessee. So I'm glad we all converse here. It's a great

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,680
community. So I wanted to say, I don't know of anybody in my life who had ever experienced a

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,040
pandemic before. I did a bit of research on this and Wikipedia has a really interesting article

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,240
about just a list of epidemics and pandemics and just how devastating they were. And it's

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,680
interesting, the Spanish flu is the most famous one that we believe likely killed around 100

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,640
million people. COVID is actually fifth currently. And the ranges are, it says seven to 35 million

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,480
just because I think it's just very difficult, especially with a new disease, to say that this

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,720
was the exact cause of death or a severe illness as opposed to something else, a comorbidity that

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,320
was going on. I learned that word during the pandemic as well. And then something I texted

47
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:03,840
you about earlier today, there's this 1545 to 1548 coccolisitis epidemic, or epidemic, it wasn't

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,240
pandemic, so it didn't go across continent, but it took out up to 80% of the Mexican population.

49
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:16,800
Yeah. I just wanted to put that out as a frame of reference that there are viruses, there are

50
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,320
organisms in this world that are that lethal, that if they were spreading, that if they were

51
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,200
spread quickly, that it could be that devastating to a population. And my understanding is that

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,960
early on in COVID, we had no idea whether this was going to be something that passed quickly.

53
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,520
It's certainly spreading, but we didn't know how quickly it was spreading and we didn't know how

54
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,160
devastating it would be. Could you talk a bit about that and just kind of explain what it was

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,400
and where the scientific mindset was and how it evolved over time?

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,600
Yeah, sure. And to be fair, when you texted me the name of that epidemic that happened in Mexico,

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,600
which I great job pronouncing it, I'm not even going to try, I never heard of it either. It just

58
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,840
wasn't on my radar. And we all know about the 1918 influenza pandemic. I think it was a bit of a

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,200
misnomer. It was called the Spanish flu. It turns out it actually originated in Kansas. But that was

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,080
always the benchmark that I think kept scientists up at night, public health officials. So when I,

61
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,840
this is a bit of an anecdote, but when I was in college, I graduated in 2003 and I took a

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,040
microbiology course during my senior year. And about two weeks into the course, there started

63
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,160
emerging a number of influenza-like cases in Asia, in China. And it turns out that this was

64
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,720
kind of the opening salvo of SARS-1. And our professor at the time kind of recognized the

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,520
opportunity, put the syllabus down, and we started basically learning microbiology just by tracking

66
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,040
SARS-1 in real time. And very quickly, we were able to track the spread of China. I think there

67
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,720
are a couple other Asian countries. It made its way to Canada as well. It eventually killed around

68
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,240
800 people worldwide. There are a few very important, I think, numbers that I think we

69
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,000
were following as a benchmark. So for influenza, back in 1918, it killed, I mean, well into the

70
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,880
double digits, numbers of individuals that infected. I want to say the mortality rate was

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,960
well into the 30s, maybe the 40s. I don't remember the exact number. At least for SARS-1,

72
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,240
at least for SARS-1 that emerged in 2003, 2004, the mortality rate was around 10%.

73
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,400
And that's also very high. And I think that that kept people up at night, certainly. Now,

74
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,760
I think one of the reasons why it didn't spread more broadly was the fact that every patient that

75
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,560
had SARS-1 was symptomatic. There were very few asymptomatic patients. And it could only

76
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,120
transmit the virus if you were symptomatic. So it was actually relatively straightforward to

77
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,600
contain it. If you were sick, you'd undergo quarantine, and they're able to kind of build

78
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,040
a wall around the virus for that reason. So when was sick and they got sick

79
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,920
relatively quickly after catching it? Yeah. And even then, they had a pretty high mortality rate.

80
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,080
So there was another coronavirus that came out in 2010, I think the 2012, called MERS,

81
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Middle Eastern Respiratory Virus, that had a higher risk of mortality. I think the vector there was

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,320
camels. But it was actually very hard to transmit. The person-to-person transmission was quite tough.

83
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,480
So it really hasn't spread that much, even though there is still, I think, outbreaks every so often.

84
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,760
So when this first emerged, I think the first cases started coming out in the news in Wuhan

85
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:08,400
and China in December. I think what we knew was there's influenza-like symptoms. It was relatively

86
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,680
quickly identified as a coronavirus, which is, to be quite frank, a known entity. Like I think-

87
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,640
So a common cold virus, right? Exactly. And it's actually, from a genetic standpoint,

88
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,880
relatively similar to SARS-1 and MERS. So you could study it at a culture. It was sequenced

89
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,280
pretty quickly. It had relatively high homology, actually, to SARS-1. So it was a known entity.

90
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:42,480
But I think it was very apparent that it also acted very differently. And one of the reasons

91
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,280
why was it just spread like wildfire. It was unknown how far it was spreading initially,

92
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,520
certainly first within China, in a particular year. And I think that it was not known why it

93
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,040
was spreading, whether it was due to fomines being spread on surfaces, or whether there was

94
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,640
a certain degree of asymptomatic spread. But I think it was probably in late December, early January

95
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,840
when China- In 2019, right? Yeah, exactly. What I think stood a lot of health officials up in their

96
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,680
chairs was the fact that China decided to lock down. It's like, OK, something serious is here.

97
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,600
Yeah. You need to start taking this seriously. And we started seeing it, some of the early cases,

98
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,880
I read actually the Biodenetorius Biogen Conference in Boston. I think New York Times reported late

99
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,440
in the year 2020 that around 300,000 people were infected just via that conference. That's an

100
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,120
insane number. Insane number. And I think it speaks to the fact that we got to that point. So

101
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,640
we knew something was brewing in Asia in beginning of 2020. And I think, I mean, correct me if I'm

102
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,400
wrong, we just went on with our lives. I don't think there was a lot of concern. This wasn't the

103
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,520
first time that something like this had popped up. I mean, I think over- I remember when I was a kid

104
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,720
and Ebola was a thing. And I was terrified that I was going to catch Ebola. But then I heard about

105
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,880
that. I heard about SARS, heard about mad cow disease, and all these scary sounding illnesses

106
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,640
popping up. But it's just out of sight, out of mind. I learned, I think a lot of us learned,

107
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,360
when this pops up, don't worry about it. It's not going to affect us. It almost felt like we had

108
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,600
this fortress here. Exactly. That prevented that we were as a population immune to these things.

109
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
So absolutely, I remember hearing about it. I remember seeing those images of the doctor

110
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,080
in the hospital bed. And he was saying, this is real. And we got to take this seriously.

111
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,320
And I was thinking, well, it's not going to come here. Yeah, exactly. And I think in January,

112
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,120
there was a lot, I mean, there was news for sure. And I think people were paying attention. But in

113
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,160
terms of editing our own lives, there was none of that. And even well into February, I think we're

114
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,400
like, okay, there's something going on over there, maybe not here. And you had a couple of

115
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,800
sporadic cases where you had an instance of someone traveling from the United States,

116
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,400
or sorry, from Asia over the United States, they would land, they were sick, and then they would

117
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,040
get tested. And then they were quarantined. But it was thought that, okay, that was an isolated

118
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:34,400
incident. And for me, there were probably two incidences that started getting me really nervous.

119
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,760
Almost even prior to the Biogen, the now famous Biogen conference that happened in March. One was

120
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:51,120
the, I think it was the Diamond Princess cruise ship. And it was, well, first an advertisement

121
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,280
not to take a cruise, unfortunately. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been on one. That's just because I get

122
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,800
motion sick. I don't even need a pathogen. But with this poor cruise ship in Asia,

123
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,600
in Asia, it basically just got slammed by COVID in the early days of the pandemic.

124
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,040
And what struck me, and I actually remember I was at work because I work in a biotech just surrounded

125
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,480
by a bunch of really smart people. And when this happened, we actually had lunch like, you know

126
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,280
what, we have a cruise ship. We know that based on the numbers that we're seeing, it's around 2%

127
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,880
mortality rate. We know that most of the people on this particular ship certainly have been exposed,

128
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,360
maybe, I forget the exact number, maybe half are infected. The curious thing was maybe half of

129
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,680
those people who tested positive were actually symptomatic, which means that there's a whole

130
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:53,120
lot of people that are asymptomatic. And what that means is unless you're incredibly, incredibly

131
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,440
diligent in testing, this virus is going to go everywhere just because you're not going to be

132
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,320
able to catch it. It's not going to be like the situation we had with SARS-1 where if you are

133
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,680
symptomatic, you could transmit it. But if you stopped someone who was symptomatic from being

134
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,040
exposing others, then you could stop it in its tracks.

135
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah. And it's sort of in like, I guess, lay terms that what we're kind of comparing here is

136
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,800
SARS-1, someone on a cruise ship somehow has it. They're really sick from the get-go. They're

137
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,880
isolating their cabin. They might not be shedding active virus or breathing it out or it might not

138
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,920
be contagious from the surface. There are many different properties of how contagious something

139
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,320
is, right? Like one virus, if we had 30 people in this basement, if I have one virus and we have

140
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,600
the same conversation, same mingling effect, I might infect one person. Another virus, I might

141
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,760
infect everybody in the room, just depending on how it acts. And we have no way, with something

142
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,200
new, no way to understand what that, is it the R0? Is that what it was called?

143
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,480
Yeah. I think a lot of people got a crash course in R0.

144
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,960
R0. Yeah. Absolutely.

145
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,080
And you try to benchmark, is it worse than measles? Is it better than measles?

146
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,720
Yeah. Yeah. And just trying to get it to, I think, trying to get it into terms that people

147
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,200
understand.

148
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,280
Yeah.

149
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah. And so I think the second event that happened in February that honestly scared me

150
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
was the fact that you had confirmed community transmission in Washington.

151
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,640
Yeah.

152
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:30,080
And I heard that, and it was confirmed that this person had not been exposed to, they hadn't

153
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,400
gone to Asia, they hadn't recently, they hadn't exposed to anyone who had recently gone to Asia.

154
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Like, okay, it's definitely here. There's a lot of asymptomatic cases. And I think that's

155
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:57,360
why I was like, okay, buckle up time. And my wife was making fun of me because I think I told you

156
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,480
the story. I got a Costco membership that day, went out to Costco, dropped a whole lot of money

157
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,880
on a large chest freezer and a ton of food. I think my wife was saying, this is what immunologists

158
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:18,720
do when they nest. Yeah, absolutely. Well, I mean, I remember exactly March 17th. It was

159
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,760
St. Patrick's Day. It was the day Tom Brady said he was going to the box. It's already a pretty

160
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,200
devastating day. Yeah, that was a rough day. But that was the last day before we locked down for

161
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,160
what we thought was going to be two weeks. Did you buy two weeks?

162
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,880
No, no. I mean, so it was a time of incredible confusion, I think, even for people that

163
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:50,640
who otherwise kind of had like at least a working foundation in virology, immunology,

164
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:57,040
epidemics in general. So you mentioned the Biogen conference. So my wife was at that conference and

165
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,480
she actually met with a Biogen leadership team and she was directly exposed to those individuals. And

166
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,200
just to give you a sense of what it was like, I think she met with them on a Thursday and Friday.

167
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,680
She actually mentioned that, yeah, they look kind of sick. She comes home, the weekend passes. I

168
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,320
think we find out it may be a Sunday night that they had tested positive. And so we're looking at

169
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:28,560
each other like, what do we do next? Do I go to work? Do I stay home? Does life just carry on? Do

170
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:36,000
I only edit my life if I show symptoms? And we just did it now. She ended up staying home,

171
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,360
which was the right call and actually never went back to work, at least in person for a very long

172
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,760
time. And so at that time, there were a number of dominoes that were falling. You had Italy,

173
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,320
for example. I think we were seeing a lot of very, very scary images of Italy, where initially you

174
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,800
knew something was happening in China. Italy was the next country where it was a lot more real,

175
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,240
just because there was a lot more information that was coming out. I think there was,

176
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,000
you actually jog my memory on this, there was a famous story of a nurse who, I think there's

177
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,680
a picture of her. And was it a ventilator that she handed over to? Yeah. So there was a

178
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,520
elderly woman on a ventilator and they were out of ventilators, so they couldn't give them to

179
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,600
everybody who was a patient, who might need them. And there was a younger person in there and they

180
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,280
said, okay, well this younger person has a better shot at survival, just because they're younger.

181
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,240
And the elderly woman said, no. She said, I've had a beautiful life and I'd like you to give this to

182
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,160
her. And it's just like, it's heartbreaking. But I'm getting chills right now thinking about it,

183
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
because during this very confusing and dark time, you have these just like beautiful moments of

184
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:56,480
humanity happening as well. And even though it was a scary time, I did see in the news,

185
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,160
but also among my community, among my friends, like some just great acts of humanity among people.

186
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
And I really, some people were really shying during that time and helping people out. And

187
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,480
whether it was sacrificing your life like that, or whether it was just getting groceries for

188
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,280
somebody who's your neighbor who may be more at risk than you are. So it was part of the

189
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,640
dynamic of that time. Yeah, it was very strange because it was coming, I think everyone,

190
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,840
I think around early March or maybe mid-March, like everyone knew something big was about to happen.

191
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,160
It was clear that it was going to hit us, but no one really knew, A, how to prepare, well,

192
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,800
probably beyond buying food and stockpiling, stockpiling toilet paper. But in terms of how

193
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,520
to prepare beyond that, I think a lot of people were just kind of like, they were preparing for

194
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:57,680
something, but not quite knowing how. Yeah, 2074, if you're listening, for whatever reason,

195
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,320
there was a massive run on toilet paper. It was the first thing to go off the shelf. We ended up

196
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,400
having a lot of supply issues for a couple of years. Toilet paper was number one. I went

197
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,320
through the house. Once it hit me that this was serious, I went through the house. I was like,

198
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,680
I think we only have like six walls of toilet paper. We better get some. I went through the

199
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,520
house. It was 92. I was like, we're good. This is the least of our concerns. I ended up doing the

200
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:27,680
same thing you did. I have a massive freezer in my garage now full of protein, full of protein and

201
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,200
frozen vegetables. I had shelves down in the basement here with all kinds of non-perishable

202
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,960
stuff. My mom thought I... My wife probably thought I was crazy, but she was supportive of me

203
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,800
and how I was processing all this. My mom thought I had gone completely that shit.

204
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,800
I mean, I had heard anecdotes. I don't know who these people are, but it's one of those friends

205
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,320
of friends things where people had... They only exhausted their toilet paper stores well into

206
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:06,400
2022 that they had established in 2020, which is remarkable. I mean, lockdown was crazy. I mean,

207
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,720
kind of going through that process. Within a company where we were, we were trying to figure

208
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,480
out all the policies for our employees. What do we say? We didn't have national guidance yet.

209
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,240
Exactly. Then on the home front, you're thinking to yourself, well, apparently I need toilet paper,

210
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,600
so I got to stack up on that, but what about other stuff? What about kids? It was a time of just

211
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,680
unbelievable uncertainty, and yet there were still kind of trickets of normalcy as well because

212
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,800
things didn't lock down until they did. Even though a lot of people sense that something big

213
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:46,560
was coming up, I still have it ingrained in my memory. I was driving my daughter back from a

214
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,520
basketball game. I forget the name. I think it was Sudbury actually. We were listening on the radio,

215
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,440
listening on the news to the recent developments, and lockdown ultimately ended up happening two

216
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,280
days later. I just remember telling it, listen, we're about to go through some really historic

217
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,560
stuff. What's about to happen is going to hit us. It's going to hit us hard. You're going to

218
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:15,440
remember this for the rest of your life. Yeah. I don't use Facebook much anymore,

219
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,520
I think because of the fact that through COVID and then into 2021, I am doom scrolling a lot.

220
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
But there's a woman that was a graduate from my high school a couple of years before me,

221
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,960
and she actually, I think only the two people from my hometown are up in the Boston area now

222
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,680
that I know of. She's a very well-respected doctor at MGH, and she just put out the PSA

223
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,800
to everyone in the group and said, this is real. I'm seeing patients. It's pretty ugly.

224
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,880
This is real. The lockdown is probably longer than, it's probably longer than two weeks.

225
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
You might be looking at it toward the end of the year, and that was shocking to me.

226
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:08,960
But I believed her, and so I started preparing for that mentally and supply-wise, and in every way

227
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,880
that I could, started preparing for that eventuality. I remember the guidelines slowly started coming

228
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,760
out, six feet social distancing, masks, and you start to kind of reset how you think about

229
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,560
just being in the community. You don't want to be in the household days. You go out for a walk,

230
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,440
but then you see someone across the street, and you are giving each other the evil eye.

231
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:42,800
Why? Because for all you know, this person could be the end of me. If this person runs up and says,

232
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,960
hi, it could be over. Those were the sorts of wild thoughts going through our heads at the time.

233
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,800
I think that the hardest part was you didn't know how to gauge risk, just because everything

234
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:04,560
was unknown. We didn't know how well masks worked. I think now we know that they did very well,

235
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,840
and social distancing certainly worked as well. But we also implemented some measures that in

236
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,880
hindsight just did not make sense at all. I was one of the many people who would go to the grocery

237
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,560
store, load up on dry goods, and then before I brought them in my house, I had to wipe them

238
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:30,560
all down with alcohol. My fingers were just decimated all year from Clorox wipes until I

239
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,560
found out that wasn't necessary. I remember the thing that hit me was I started learning about

240
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:44,640
viral shedding and that younger kids especially seemed to largely be asymptomatic, but that they

241
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:52,960
just shed and shed and they shed a lot of virus. So if you held a baby or a young kid up to your face,

242
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,800
you could just be getting a devastating amount of COVID that your system is not ready for.

243
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,680
You had a two-year-old at the time, so it was pretty scary. I think it might be a good time to

244
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:17,040
talk about the concept of bubbling. It was a tough time for everybody, but I think kids especially.

245
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:27,200
Two years old, that's a major time in life to start developing social skills. With one child

246
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:35,120
at home, it was just, what do we do? We were fortunate that we were able to find a family

247
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,240
with similar-aged kids. They had similar risk tolerances as us, similar testing policies,

248
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,800
and we just found this nice connection where the kids could get together and hang out.

249
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,600
I would drive every week to urgent care and get swabbed and make sure that I was

250
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,160
still negative. That just became the norm for a long time.

251
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,440
Yeah. It was a strange time because you almost had a bifurcation.

252
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,120
At the time, we were living in Arlington. It was a relatively dense neighborhood.

253
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,760
One of the things that happened was when lockdown happened, people went outside. I actually met a

254
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,320
whole lot of neighbors, obviously from a distance that I had not met before, just because people

255
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,920
didn't have anything else to do. People would go outside. They would talk from a distance again

256
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,200
at the local park. I actually met a lot of people that I, even though I had lived in that house for

257
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,920
I think a number of years, had not even seen them. Never mind had met them. That was,

258
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:56,800
I guess, different. For kids, I had a sixth grader, a fifth grader, and a second grader.

259
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:06,560
The kids got hit pretty hard because when you're a kid, you need to be social. That is an

260
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,200
incredibly strong urge. When you're trying to keep kids apart, it's just really tough.

261
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,160
Fortunately, we had a household of three so they could play with each other.

262
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:21,840
I think that helped them a lot. Being restricted to play with their friends,

263
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,760
that was definitely difficult. I remember seeing at the local playgrounds, because they shut down

264
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,200
all the colleges, they basically just sent all the kids home the first couple of weeks of lockdown.

265
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:43,280
You had a lot of college students, high schoolers as well, that parents just could not restrain.

266
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:53,120
Their urge, obviously, at that age is to go be social. You tell a group of high schoolers

267
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,280
that, no, you can't get together and be social and pick up basketball and go do stuff. It's

268
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,120
really tough. That's really tough. You're someone like the bad guy from Footloose.

269
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,080
Yeah, exactly. They were pushing the limits of social distancing as far as they could.

270
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,280
Absolutely.

271
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:19,840
Rightfully so. I remember thinking to myself, okay, I think we can probably socially distance

272
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:28,480
and lockdown for maybe two or three months. After that, I think just human beings are social

273
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,200
creatures. They need to be around each other. After that, there's just no way.

274
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:45,280
Yeah. It slowly started to emerge for us personally too. I had golf before in my life,

275
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,480
but I started playing a lot more golf because it was really easy to be distant.

276
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:58,320
A lot of fires in the backyard and a solo stove, solo stoves with some neighbors. I had

277
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,000
moved here relatively recently when this all started and had moved here when my son was

278
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,280
nine months old. That year and a quarter, I hadn't met a ton of people yet. I was just starting to

279
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:20,720
come out of that early baby time. I have friends now where it's hard to remember this, but I have

280
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:29,440
friends in my neighborhood here that I knew for a year before I stepped foot in their house. My

281
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,040
in-laws moved nearby and it was a year before we would go to their yard and play and they would be

282
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:45,280
up on the porch and we'd be talking 30 feet away. It was really just so strange.

283
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,720
You got pretty good at having outdoor meals under heaters.

284
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:59,120
Yes. There's this Concord Family Network and a friend of mine and I, three weeks before

285
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,520
COVID hit, had taken responsibility to organize Dad's Night Out. All of a sudden we're at,

286
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,600
okay, how do we do this? We're locked down for the year. We organized all these.

287
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,960
There was a Children's Cafe and they organized, oh, we'll just put together a meal for you and

288
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,800
a beer sampler or whiskey sampler and you can all go on Zoom and try all these things together and

289
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,520
talk about them. There was a fun part there of just making the best of it and trying to meet people.

290
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:40,560
It's worth talking about the virtual life that we all went from reality to virtual reality

291
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:48,880
to Zoom overnight. Overnight to Zoom, yeah. I was thinking about this the other day.

292
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,680
There are a few key pieces of technology that if they weren't around during COVID,

293
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,760
I don't know how we would have made it. One of the biggest ones was obviously being able to

294
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,160
communicate via the internet but being able to do so virtually as well and do so seamlessly with

295
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:14,080
some honestly awesome software. It allowed a lot of people just to go home on one day and then the

296
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:22,640
next day flip open their laptops, rejigger their home office. I think a lot of couples, a lot of

297
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,720
families went through the growing pains of trying to figure out where exactly the home offices are

298
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:37,120
and are not in order to not be disrupted by kids, by pets, by spouses. Going through that process,

299
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,360
you were suddenly going from talking to people all day to just staring at a computer screen all day,

300
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,600
just overnight. People did that really quickly. Did you pick up any weird hobbies during COVID?

301
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:02,800
Yeah. Let's see. I did. I got into woodworking more. I remember, while I don't think we did this,

302
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,440
there were certain trends that you would see where suddenly everyone was into something,

303
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
then everyone was into something else. I think one of the first trends that came around was

304
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,880
sourdough bread. Absolutely. Yeah. I remember people naming their sourdough starters. There's

305
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:25,280
Vladimir Gluten. I can't remember all the ones that came out. My buddy Matt, who we did the

306
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,800
Conquer Family Network thing, he's an awesome guy. He's a rugby player, so he's just a big

307
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,280
jacked guy. That's not the typical profile somebody that you think is, he's an excellent,

308
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:46,880
excellent cook, very good cook. He bought five pounds of bread flour. He was like,

309
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,960
there's no way to throw all this. He came and split it with me. We went back and forth,

310
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:59,760
hey man, I'm making bagels today. We're sharing recipes. I would say that on a scale from one to

311
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:08,640
10, my wife and I went from being 0.5 out of 10 to, we're a solid five now. We definitely

312
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,840
got better because at the beginning in concrete, the door dash team was basically 0. It's grown a

313
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,040
ton now. There are a lot of options you can get, but take out and delivery just wasn't really a

314
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,440
thing around here. It was a lot of home cooking. That's right. That's a good point actually,

315
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,240
because lockdown happened. Suddenly, everyone was cooking three meals a day. You had to brush off

316
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,400
your skill set and relearn how to do that if you weren't before. There was also, you talk

317
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,840
about people who got hit pretty hard, the restaurants. It was like a surgical strike

318
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,680
on the service community. Yeah. A lot of my favorite places in the Boston area are gone now.

319
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Yeah. I think there was certainly a lot of goodwill and people trying to help out restaurants by

320
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,680
going above and beyond to order out. Certainly, it wasn't enough for a lot of places,

321
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,120
but restaurants, you talk about just trying to figure out how to survive.

322
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:13,120
They went from having a full room to, if they're lucky, and they had enough of a cash cushion,

323
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,880
suddenly turning into a delivery only business. Then you had pretty strong

324
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,520
emergence of these food delivery services. Yeah. Well, you ever go to Red Bones in Summerville,

325
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,800
Fair Square? Yeah. That's transformed from, you never could get delivery from there,

326
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,760
but that was a hotspot. It was a hangout spot, lunch and dinner. I went there,

327
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,040
and I went there a month ago with a buddy of mine. When I lived in Davis Square, I used to go there

328
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,320
once a week. It's almost purely takeout now. It's actually kind of odd if you're there eating.

329
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,600
Is it the whole order with a QR code type? Yeah, absolutely.

330
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,880
Yeah. That's new as well. I think that- QR code.

331
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,160
A touchless ordering. Yeah.

332
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,080
Necessity is the mother of invention. It didn't go out to be true.

333
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:05,360
Just to give a sense of how desolate it was outside of people's houses, I remember it was in,

334
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,000
it must have been in probably late March. No, it must have been in April at some point.

335
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,480
I took the family. We were going completely stir crazy. We decided to drive to my sister's house

336
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,320
who lives in Brookline. We took the long way just because we were curious to see what the city looked

337
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:28,560
like. We saw maybe a car the entire way driving from Arlington all the way to Brookline. It was

338
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,640
not even people outside. People were inside. It was so eerie.

339
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,200
Yeah. It's eerie. I remember driving into Boston

340
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,760
times and just being like, it's not supposed to take 15 minutes to get into Boston.

341
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,720
No. Yeah, it's crazy.

342
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't think we'll see that unless, I mean, knock on wood, I can't imagine another scenario

343
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,160
where we'll see that. Yeah. I will say that I do have two Bonsai trees as a result of

344
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,240
the pandemic. I got a jade and a juniper. There's a store Bonsai West in Hatton. It's really cool.

345
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,680
I tried to get a pine, but they wouldn't let me. They're like, you're too much of a beginner.

346
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,720
You're just going to kill it. They're like, if you can pass the juniper, then you can get a pine.

347
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah. Sadly, I named them Leroy and Jenkins because I was just,

348
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,240
if anyone knows the Leroy Jenkins story, it's a story of just going into something

349
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,600
guns a blazing without any real forethought into the fact that I'm probably not very good

350
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,400
taking care of plants. These plants will be alive in 50 years, right?

351
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,480
Unfortunately, Juniper Jenkins did not make it. Oh, no.

352
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:43,840
But Leroy, Leroy the Jade is thriving and I took one, I clipped off a branch and planted it

353
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,040
in Juniper Jenkins soil and that one is growing now too. Yeah, it's a baby.

354
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,840
So that was kind of fun. I needed something kind of peaceful to do. So it was a good time. I know

355
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,040
a lot of people picked up some weird hobbies. I'd love to, if anyone listening to this wants

356
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,520
to let us know, let me know. I've heard about rock polishing.

357
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,640
Oh yeah. I think that was one of the most

358
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,520
surprising hobbies that I heard about. Like that actually sounds very, very calming.

359
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:25,440
Well, I feel like when I was kind of eight to 12 year old zone, like any museum or any kind of

360
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,080
like kids friendly place that we went to, there were rock polishing kits. I bet, I think a lot

361
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:36,720
of us probably like kind of went back to things that are comfortable to us at the time. To me,

362
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,040
like I am total amateur armchair psychologist. I've never even took a psychology course and I'm

363
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,120
fascinated by the subject. I'm just fascinated about the raw human responses to some of this stuff

364
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,640
from seeking comfort to, you know, I think the response of some of the public to basically just

365
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,440
deny that this was happening at all until it hit them directly is that's just a human subconscious

366
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,240
response to something of just how to react to an existential threat. I actually heard a really

367
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,120
interesting story today. I was listening to some history of Omaha Beach D-Day and they were saying

368
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:17,120
that these guys, despite all their training, they just went into this subconscious response of they're

369
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:23,200
getting machine gun fire at them and it's just, you know, the ninth level of hell. And there's this

370
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,720
human response when something happens and you just start digging a hole. To get in the hole

371
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,200
and just wait until it's over and then come back out. And it's like people were digging holes

372
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,920
under the water and it made absolutely no logical sense on this reaction to it. But this is just a

373
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,120
human response. I think that the word head in the sand was used a lot for, I think, groups of people

374
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,640
who were just like, no, this isn't happening. It's not real. And I think that that, I'm not saying

375
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,880
as a political thing or anything like that, I just think it's fascinating the human response

376
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:05,840
to something like this happening. And I think we all had interesting things happen to us in

377
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:11,440
different mental states during this time. So it was definitely kind of wild. I think maybe part of the

378
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,320
reason why we blocked out so many memories when we were talking about doing this.

379
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,680
No, I definitely, I probably went hoarse a few times yelling at the TV in the early days.

380
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,920
Just given the background.

381
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,360
So, yeah, we went through kind of like the social stuff and maybe we can bring back to the science.

382
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,520
So I know you were saying that we know coronavirus. We found out pretty quickly what this was.

383
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah. What's the pathway then to vaccines, treatments, like how, from a scientific

384
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,880
standpoint, what are you looking for and how are these things created and why mRNA?

385
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:08,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. So with COVID-19, we actually, because of SARS 1, we had in a little

386
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:15,920
bit of a weird way, a bit of a leg up. So SARS 1 came out early 2000s and what, and I think it

387
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:23,440
put on the radar the fact that coronaviruses are nasty. I mean, very high likelihood that at some

388
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,120
point in human history, another coronavirus pandemic is going to come and hit us pretty hard.

389
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,720
And that kind of triggered surveillance programs. I think that there are some,

390
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,400
actually now infamous surveillance programs that were established in Asia.

391
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,720
There was also a lot of basic research that went into trying to figure out how best to generate

392
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,720
a good immune response against essentially pieces of coronavirus. So I think

393
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:04,240
I think vaccinology for years has generally taken the form of taking bits of a virus, whether

394
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,200
it's an inactivated dead virus or whether it's recombinant pieces of a virus, essentially

395
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,240
proteins that are directly derived from a virus that have identified to elicit a very good immune

396
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,080
response. Kind of mixing that with at times another agent that can kind of ramp up the immune

397
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:30,880
response at the same time, and then you use it as a vaccine. And I mean, we all get childhood vaccines.

398
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:39,280
We don't really talk about measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, meningitis

399
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,440
anymore because we get vaccinated against those as children. Smallpox isn't around anymore as a

400
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:57,840
result, et cetera. So they're extremely effective. And with vaccines, usually the whole drug discovery,

401
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,000
drug development process, it takes on the order of decades, not years, decades. It usually takes

402
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,440
minimum 10 years to come up with a good vaccine, then run all of the clinical trials first in

403
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,360
healthy humans, and then just identify safety, and then phase two, phase three. And finally,

404
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,240
you get approval, and then you'll get a large pharmaceutical company like a Pfizer

405
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,360
to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses, almost never billions, to be honest,

406
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:36,560
but usually hundreds of millions of doses for peak sales. So vaccines are viewed as,

407
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,480
and they have for a while, as probably the best weapon that we could ever elicit against a pandemic.

408
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:52,720
Now, what happened with COVID-19, there was a few kind of just underlying insights that were

409
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,960
generated that we didn't know what at the time kind of set us up for success. One was the

410
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,600
development of mRNA technology. And I think it's been an idea that's been kicked around for a while,

411
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:12,960
where rather than taking bits of a virus, either recombinant protein that's directly derived from

412
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:22,320
a virus or a heat-inactivated virus, why don't we take a step back and use mRNA, which actually

413
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:29,360
encodes the protein, and deliver that to a patient in order to vaccinate. And it's an idea that

414
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:37,680
could apply not just to vaccinations, but also diseases like protein replacement, diseases like

415
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:46,080
chemophilia. Can we use mRNA, administer it to a patient, and have it express monoclonal antibodies,

416
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:53,520
which are used as a therapeutic as well, quite broadly. So with vaccines, that idea was definitely

417
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:04,480
out there. I think at the time, there was probably a notion that mRNA-based vaccines,

418
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,760
in the instance of a pandemic, could be a technology that could be quickly turned around

419
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,040
and used. And you had a couple of companies, one being BioNTech, the other being Moderna,

420
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,800
that established a lot of the research, establishing that this could be done, certainly

421
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,920
in preclinical animal models, and I think at least in early-stage clinical development. So the

422
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,280
technology, I think, was maybe not ready for prime time, but it's probably at the brink,

423
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,400
ready for prime time. Also, a lot of the basic science that was done in support of figuring out

424
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,640
and studying SARS-1 was directly applicable to COVID-19. One good example is that there was

425
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,200
some really nice work that came out of labs from collaboration from Scripps, NIH, and actually

426
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,920
Dartmouth, where they used the spike protein. I think everyone who has gone through the pandemic

427
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,640
now knows that there's something on COVID called the spike protein. And it's basically...

428
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,680
It's the key to entry to the cell, yeah.

429
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,160
Exactly. Exactly. If you think of COVID virus particles as a golf ball, exactly, the spike

430
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,560
protein is what attaches to the cell, it allows the virus to actually get in. It's also

431
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,240
a bit of the Achilles heel of the virus, because that's what the immune response tends to recognize,

432
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,280
at least antibodies that are generated. So it's a very good target to generate vaccines against.

433
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,480
And so there was some work where it was initially observed that the spike protein

434
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,480
in SARS and MERS was actually very floppy. It didn't express well. When you tried to

435
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,640
express the protein and use it in the context of a vaccine, it just didn't generate a good

436
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
immune response. So they identified a couple of point mutations that they could make, just

437
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,440
switching a couple of amino acids in the spike protein that made it a lot more rigid. And those

438
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,520
mutations ultimately ended up in both the Moderna and Pfizer, the BioNTech Pfizer products. And if

439
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,560
that insight hadn't been made, if mRNA technology kind of wasn't at the brink of prime time,

440
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,640
I don't think we would have had a COVID vaccine.

441
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah. So you had...

442
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,160
We'd still be in it.

443
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,920
We certainly...

444
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,200
Unless it mutated down to...

445
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,720
It would be... There would be, I mean, a lot, under the order of millions more people that

446
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:25,360
would be dead, unfortunately, if we hadn't had that. And so you had mRNA vaccines kind of at the

447
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:31,600
brink of prime time. You had these insights as to what exactly the target from a vaccine standpoint

448
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:37,040
and what both Moderna and Pfizer did as soon as the sequence was available. I think this was in

449
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,400
January at some time. They were just off to the races. And they basically reduced

450
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:54,560
10 years of drug discovery and drug development into about nine months. They were dosing patients

451
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,680
in a matter of months for phase one. And they evaluated multiple vaccine candidates in parallel

452
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,840
and at risk started manufacturing, or at least establishing the manufacturing footprint needed

453
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:17,120
to manufacture vaccines first for phase three, they'd just skip phase two, into phase three,

454
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,880
and then for commercial development. So I was actually in the Pfizer trial.

455
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah, you were early.

456
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,040
Yeah, I was early.

457
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,160
And how nervous were you?

458
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:34,960
So it's a good question. I was not actually. And I know, and this is where I probably benefited

459
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,280
a little bit just from my knowledge of mRNA, because I knew the components of the vaccine,

460
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,760
it was a lipid nanoparticle, which is basically a little bit of grease. It's very similar chemical

461
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,720
composition to what the membranes of our cell contain today. It's really no different. So I

462
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,760
wasn't worried about that. mRNA is mRNA. It's a genetic code that is highly transient.

463
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:08,800
If it enters your cells, it's usually gone within a few days. But it certainly does a lot of business

464
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,520
while it's in the cell. So honestly, I wasn't that worried. I was actually pretty excited.

465
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,360
Are you bonded that you didn't get superpowers?

466
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:26,720
I am actually. I was expecting some more of a like activity. And so, I mean, I remember actually

467
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,400
going in for my first appointment. What month was this?

468
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,320
This would have been in August, actually.

469
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,360
August 2020.

470
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,480
Yeah, August 2020.

471
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,000
Wow. Yeah. So five months after we knew it was real.

472
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,400
Exactly. And I actually calculated, I was within the first 10,000 days of the vaccine.

473
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,520
10,000 patients dosed. Yeah. Within the first 10 for the Pfizer.

474
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,720
And you didn't know at the time if you had actually gotten a vaccine or if it was placebo?

475
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,360
Had no idea.

476
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,560
And you were instructed just live your life as you normally would.

477
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:00,880
Exactly.

478
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,160
And we're going to keep testing you.

479
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,400
They viewed me as high risk because I had kids.

480
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:13,920
And because we lived fairly close to Boston. And so, got the shot, felt nothing. Carried on with

481
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,080
my life. I was a little bummed that I didn't feel anything because that hinted to me that I might

482
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:26,640
have gotten placebo rather than the vaccine. Then 21 days later, got a second shot. Also felt nothing.

483
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,600
Was also bummed that I didn't feel anything because that confirmed to me at least that I thought.

484
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,160
Because they told you you might be sore or feel out of it or something.

485
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah. I thought I would have felt something because usually when you get vaccines,

486
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,960
your arm is like flu vaccine. Your arm is usually kind of sore.

487
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,680
Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,280
And so-

489
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,240
And I've heard that lipid nanoparticle, I mean it's nanoparticle, it's actually fairly big

490
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,600
as a delivery device that it can make. That's kind of what makes you tired and sore.

491
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,040
And so, yeah.

492
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,640
It's good at eliciting immune responses. So lipid nanoparticles are generally the size of a virus.

493
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,280
Yeah.

494
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,920
And so, one of the major innovations that was made that kind of led mRNA vaccines to actually be real

495
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:18,000
was at a Nobel Prize was given to Drew Weissman and Carolyn Catalanco. They identified how to

496
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,440
de-immunize mRNA. So to make it not elicit an immune response by changing particular,

497
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,760
making chemical changes in the actual nucleic acid. And that actually was kind of the key.

498
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,920
Because otherwise your body would recognize the mRNA that was administered and reject it.

499
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,640
Attack it, yeah.

500
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,760
So what they figured out was a way to essentially mask it from the human immune system. It would

501
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:44,720
allow it to then essentially be translated into whatever protein it was supposed to translate.

502
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,320
But the LNP portion actually did serve as a good immune enhancing

503
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,560
adjuvant, which is why the vaccines just work so well.

504
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,280
Yeah, great.

505
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,280
So with...

506
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,920
Did anything change after the trial to the one that you got then the one that I got?

507
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,680
Did anything change in terms of density of mRNA delivered or anything like that?

508
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:13,920
I think they changed... Yeah, so the first... First off, the vaccine was 90% effective for...

509
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,640
I think it was called the Wuhan strain.

510
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,520
Wow.

511
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:25,280
Then they realized that other strains are on the horizon. So because coronavirus is a

512
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,680
positive RNA stranded virus, it has a tendency to undergo a low rate of mutational change.

513
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:38,720
And that was manifest in subsequent strains of COVID, unfortunately. I think the big ones were

514
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,880
Delta, where you had a couple of mutations in the spike region. Then the big one was Omicron,

515
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,560
which hit us really hard about a year after the pandemic first started, where you had some

516
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,520
additional changes that... And those changes, what they tended to do was evade our existing

517
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:00,400
immune response as well as to some of the vaccines from the get go. So with the vaccines,

518
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,920
what they had to do first was rather than two shots, providing a third shot would then bring

519
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:16,320
our immunity back up to level between the Wuhan strain and the Delta strain. So two shots, 90%

520
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,240
activity against the Wuhan strain, but there's a drop off for Delta. You give a third shot,

521
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,520
then you're able to boost immunity back up to the Delta strain. But the problem is that COVID is

522
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:34,080
going to continue to mutate and work to evade the immunity that the vaccines were able to elicit.

523
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:40,960
So Omicron, we actually had to get a tweak, the actual sequence of the mRNA within the virus in

524
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,520
order to make it better match the Omicron strain. Cool. Yeah. I'm trying to follow along as much

525
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,280
as I can. As I've been... I've gotten all my boosters and everything. I've been a good boy.

526
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,280
I have two questions left. One is, you told me a story that I think would be awesome if you shared

527
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:08,720
it. You Mr. Wizarded your own testing. How does that work? Yeah. So in the early days of the

528
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,920
pandemic, being able to access tests was an issue. I think I mentioned earlier that we were largely

529
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:23,280
blind. So the first test I ever had, I think it was through a commercial vendor. I'm guessing it

530
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,200
was in the spring at some point. Things were so chaotic that they never sent me the results.

531
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,040
I think I paid like a hundred bucks out of pocket and it just never showed up. So

532
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,680
being able to access a good COVID test was a major, major problem. And they also were not cheap.

533
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,000
So one of the benefits of being in biotech is you have a lot of like-minded individuals around you

534
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,840
that kind of egg each other on and encourage you to kind of operate at the edges. So we set up...

535
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,240
I actually set up together with a couple of my biotech friends, kind of a home testing

536
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:10,320
system where I purchased a early 90s vintage PCR machine. It was a very, very cheap machine.

537
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,680
A PCR machine which allows you to do the thermo-cycling that is required in order to amplify

538
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:22,320
the actual nucleic acid regions of COVID. So I purchased it on eBay for, believe it or not,

539
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,680
like 150 bucks, which I'm actually to this day, I'm surprised it was so inexpensive.

540
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,320
It was definitely an early model where I actually had to think folks, scientists,

541
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:39,120
we'll get the reference, actually had to use mineral oil and apply it on top of the reaction

542
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:46,880
just because that's how archaic the PCR machine was. So worked with a couple of my biotech

543
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,840
colleagues to procure reagents. And we actually pooled funds, we shared reagents. And we would

544
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:59,600
essentially optimize protocols in parallel to each other and kind of share tips as to what the best

545
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:07,440
possible protocol could be. And what this meant was is that anytime, and the example I'll use is

546
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:15,360
when my brother was visiting from out of town and we're about to get together for Easter.

547
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:23,280
Brother came into town. Before he basically came into our house, we had him swab as well as his

548
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,120
family. We did a quick PCR test on our kitchen counter. I'm sitting there with my gloves,

549
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,840
literally on my kitchen counter. Tests came up negative. Okay, you can come into the house.

550
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,840
Then we tested them again the next day before we went to go visit my parents. And

551
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,160
the lengths that you would go through just to make sure that you were clean before you were

552
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,760
visiting family, I mean, people would crawl through mud in order to get there just to make sure

553
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:59,760
that things were safe. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we had the same deal when my mom and stepdad came out

554
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:07,120
to visit. And first time they came out, totally innocuous, nothing happened. Second time they came

555
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:13,840
out, two days in, I had a scratchy throat. I took a test and that turned out positive. So I just ran

556
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,440
out of the basement, called them an Uber and they were on the next flight back at that point.

557
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,680
And it was just like, I felt awful. And you feel guilty. You feel guilty. Like, what did I just do?

558
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:30,240
You know, and I'm like, this is my mom and my stepdad. I don't want to be responsible for them

559
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:39,520
getting seriously ill. And yeah, my stepdad, they both ended up catching COVID. Both ended up being

560
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:46,080
fine. My mom got hit pretty hard by it and I just felt awful. But I think everyone has a similar

561
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:54,000
story from that time. You feel like an idiot for getting sick. I don't even know where I got it.

562
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,600
Probably wasn't working out the groceries hard enough.

563
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,800
So one thing I wanted to cover before we wrap up is looking into 2074.

564
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,120
Hopefully there's not another pandemic before then, but if one hits 2074,

565
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:18,640
give them some tips. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, hopefully this doesn't happen. Unfortunately,

566
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:27,280
I actually think we kind of got lucky with this one. I know, I'm just going to not to bring everyone

567
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,520
down, but the fact is, is that the mortality rate for COVID was actually pretty low. If you think

568
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,920
about the mortality rates that we've touched on for the 1918 flu, as well as SARS-1, we actually

569
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:50,080
dodged a little bit of a bullet. And it was a bit of a highlight that I think that there's certain

570
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:57,840
areas that we definitely could have done better in terms of preparation. The good news is that

571
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:03,840
it certainly shed light on the need to be very vigilant upfront, just making sure that you have

572
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:11,040
mass testing, that you're able to track it. Because we just did. And we lost some weeks as a result.

573
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,160
The mRNA technology is certainly not going anywhere. It's an incredibly powerful tool,

574
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:26,880
I think, in our arsenal. It also is going to evolve. I was thinking about what times of crisis like

575
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:35,040
COVID, what it catalyzes. And I think a good analogy could be, you think about the technical

576
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,080
innovations that came about just because of World War II, or just because of the Cold War.

577
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:46,080
I mean, for World War II, you had computers, you had nuclear power, radar. From the Cold War,

578
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,680
you had a lot of just major leaps and bounds based off of that foundational technology.

579
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,920
I think for COVID-19, we're probably going to see at least something analogous. Maybe not something

580
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,200
similar, but something analogous, at least to add to our arsenal.

581
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,800
Yeah. It's incredible what humans can do. I mean, give someone a task in a deadline,

582
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,400
they can do it. And in times of crisis, the deadline is always tomorrow.

583
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,120
Yeah.

584
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:18,240
So, and it is incredible to me to hear you say something that should have taken a decade,

585
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,080
as we can condense down to you had it in five months.

586
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:29,440
It's incredible. I mean, what Pfizer-Moderna did is incredible. I mean, the way I look at it is,

587
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,880
no matter what, biology will win. Like at the end of the day, and I think there was a famous,

588
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,080
more popular slogan that science will win. I think that might have been Pfizer's tag line.

589
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,360
But anyway, I'll call it biology will win, just so it's not necessarily an advertisement for

590
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:49,360
Pfizer here. But the reality is biology will win. The virus is going to figure out a way to do what

591
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:54,160
it's going to do. And the big question is, how can you actually harness that biology for good?

592
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,920
How can you figure out what the Achilles heel of that particular biology could be and make

593
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,520
it work for you rather than against you?

594
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,360
Yeah. Awesome. Well, this has been amazing. I think we had other stuff that was on the list,

595
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,640
but I don't want to go too long. Anyone with my attention span isn't going to make it past here.

596
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,760
But this has been great, very educational. A trip down memory dark alley.

597
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,760
A little bit of PTSD there.

598
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:32,000
Yeah, a little bit. But I think we all had interesting times. I think everyone had

599
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,600
lost during the time. I thought it would be good to talk about this from those different points

600
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:47,920
of view and just cover it. So I hope it's been educational and 2075 humans.

601
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,480
Yeah.

602
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,920
I hope you're healthy and happy.

603
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,960
Hopefully your health care workers and your scientists are as dedicated and hardworking

604
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,400
and self-sacrificing as they were. If you ever do go through this again,

605
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,840
as they were at this time around.

606
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:07,440
Absolutely. Well, thanks so much and we'll sign off and get back to the daily thing.
