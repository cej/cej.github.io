1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,480
This is Concord Storytellers and I have with me a very special guest.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,000
Concord resident, neighbor, friend, turns out amazing squash player, mediocre golfer

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,920
and a 2023 Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly Lawyer of the Year.

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,880
I actually Googled you for the first time ever this week since, you know, thank you

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,120
so much for coming on and doing an episode with me.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,760
Charlotte Whitmore and you have, I think, one of the coolest jobs that I have ever heard.

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,240
You're one of the first people I met when I moved here and you told me what you did

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,880
and I just, my jaw dropped.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,840
I said I'm basically living among a superhero.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,840
So can you describe for me what you do with the Innocence Project?

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Yeah, absolutely.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,680
So right now I have two roles.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,320
I am a senior staff attorney at the Boston College Innocence Program and the Boston College

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,600
Innocence Program is a clinical legal education program out of BC Law where we investigate

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,320
and litigate wrongful conviction cases along with second and third year law students.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,480
So through my work at, I'll call it BCIP for short, through my work at BCIP, everything

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,920
I do for a case from case intake to gathering documents to reviewing documents, interviewing

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,480
witnesses and of course all the litigation that goes into writing a wrongful conviction

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,460
I do alongside of law students.

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,480
So we're teaching them how to litigate these cases by actually doing it.

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,080
And recently I also started about a little over a year ago as the legal director of a

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,880
relatively new nonprofit called Life After Justice.

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
Life After Justice is unique because it seeks to eradicate wrongful convictions but it's

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,880
founded and led by people who themselves have been exonerated after wrongful convictions.

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,680
So we have a unique perspective there being led by people who have been directly impacted

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
by the criminal justice system.

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,240
How does that dovetail with the Innocence Project?

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,600
So the term the Innocence Project is actually trademarked and it belongs to the Innocence

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,240
Project in New York which was founded by Barry Schack and Peter Neufeld in 1992.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,860
That was the first Innocence Project.

31
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,360
The Innocence Project was founded right after DNA became started to be used in criminal

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:58,280
cases and Barry and Peter saw this way for them to investigate potential wrongful convictions

33
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,280
by testing evidence for DNA that had not been previously tested.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,240
So the Innocence Project still primarily works on cases only cases where DNA can conclusively

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,840
prove innocence and they're a national organization.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,020
So they work on cases all over the country.

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,920
Since they founded the Innocence Project many many statewide Innocence Programs or Innocence

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,560
Projects have been founded.

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,120
I think there are high 60s low 70s of Innocence Programs nationwide and those programs together

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,680
form the Innocence Network.

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,980
And we meet annually and we share ideas and thoughts via email and help each other out

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,200
with cases that we're litigating but we are all separate nonprofits.

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,640
Some are associated with law schools.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,460
Some are standalone 501c3s.

45
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,240
Everyone has their own criteria.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,380
Most are state specific and many now investigate cases that do not involve DNA evidence.

47
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,360
Most of my cases do not involve DNA evidence.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Gotcha.

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,620
Yeah I watched as prep for this I watched this show The Innocence Files on Netflix.

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a great show I recommend to anybody to watch.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,680
It's a nine part limited docu-series and they talked a bit about that and they mentioned

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,600
that this term forensic science was actually a very bad name for what this was before DNA

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,480
evidence was launched and it was really investigators detectives coming up with creative methods

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:36,040
of solving crimes but there was no actual science no rigor of science behind it so that

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,520
I think the first three episodes were about bite mark cases and how this science that

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,600
became famous because someone presented bite marks in a Ted Bundy's case became the rage

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,120
for detectives and ended up being kind of very very bad science and resulted in a number

58
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
of wrongful convictions.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Have you I guess have you said you haven't dealt you don't deal much with DNA evidence

60
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,080
and some of these I guess bad forensic evidence cases like what sort of stuff happens in the

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,320
cases that you work on.

62
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Well I do.

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,600
So a number of my cases have involved DNA evidence to some extent.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,320
It's just that they're not cases where DNA alone could conclusively prove innocence so

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:30,000
we retest evidence and then we simultaneously reinvestigate the case by talking to witnesses

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,600
experts things like that but but as you noted there's a there's a number of sciences that

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,960
have significantly changed over the past few decades.

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,280
For example I've had I've had three or four cases recently that are that were arson convictions

69
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,240
but the field of fire science has significantly changed since the 80s and 90s and for example

70
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,040
a lot of the burn patterns that investigators thought were indicative of accelerant which

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,200
would indicate that a fire was an arson as opposed to an accident.

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:10,440
We now know are equally present in accidental fires as if fires caused by accelerant and

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,460
these types of patterns don't necessarily mean that accelerant was involved.

74
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,240
Other types of sciences that have changed are shaken baby science or abusive head trauma.

75
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,400
There's been significant changes in our understanding of symptoms that may or may not be caused

76
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,360
by by abuse as well as hair microscopy.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:39,320
So in the 80s and 90s technicians would look at a hair under a microscope and as well as

78
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,440
perhaps a hair that was found on a victim's body for instance and they would testify to

79
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,880
a you know degree of scientific certainty and sometimes as a conclusive match that the

80
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:59,140
hair found on the victim's body matched as in you know 100 percent to the exclusion of

81
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:09,480
all others a hair from the suspect and that that science has been largely debunked where

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,800
a technician could testify that a hair was similar or a hair did not match but cannot

83
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,960
make a conclusive match and so we've been as an innocence community reviewing many many

84
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,520
cases in which the hair microscopy testimony was it was extremely misleading if not false.

85
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,240
Gotcha and I mean I have to imagine that there are new topics that come in every year is

86
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,120
that is that a big part of this annual network meeting you have is to say here's some new

87
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,800
problems we're finding with with evidence gathering such as the hair microscopy is that

88
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,960
something that you say okay well we're going to go back to all these cases that we have

89
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
on file and look for ones that match this new scientific method and we'll look for one

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,320
that we think we could possibly win.

91
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,440
Absolutely yeah so we'll hear from litigators across the country who are experienced in

92
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,120
these types of cases we'll have experts you know arson experts or DNA experts or eyewitness

93
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,280
identification experts come in and speak at our conferences and we we definitely try to

94
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,320
learn from each other both in litigation strategies learning about the science but also the best

95
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,440
ways to go about reinvestigating these types of cases for example the hair microscopy that

96
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,640
we were just talking about there's been a lot of collaboration in reviewing those cases

97
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:36,680
with the prosecution in many states because it's agreed upon that that testimony was not

98
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,960
accurate and so we also share strategies on how best to collaborate with government agencies.

99
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Gotcha.

100
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,240
I want to go back in time a bit and just talk about your pathway to this career did you

101
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,840
always want to be a lawyer growing up?

102
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,360
No I wanted to be a teacher.

103
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,640
Okay and you are now.

104
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,120
That's true different than I than I imagined I all through undergrad I planned on being

105
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,800
a teacher my brother did teach for America I wanted to teach in an inner city and then

106
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,200
when I was a senior in college I randomly came across a job listing for a paralegal

107
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,960
at the federal defenders in New York which is the federal public defender system and

108
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,140
I applied for the job drove down to New York got it and that and that job changed my whole

109
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,960
trajectory as a you know 22 year old straight out of college I was spending three or four

110
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,520
days a week in very high security federal detention centers in Manhattan and Brooklyn

111
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:50,880
meeting with clients helping attorneys investigate and defend these clients and that is certainly

112
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,080
what made me want to go to law school and be a public defender or work in the innocence

113
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
field.

114
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,800
Awesome and I saw there was a Dartmouth magazine article about you it was your first case Eugene

115
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
Gillyard when you graduated law school?

116
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,560
That was my one of my first cases at the Pennsylvania Innocence Project so after I graduated from

117
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,520
law school I did two different clerkships for judges in Pennsylvania and then went to

118
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,320
work for the Pennsylvania Innocence Project and Eugene was my first successful case out

119
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
of Pennsylvania.

120
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,680
Wow and this is where this is where again my jaw dropped when I saw this description

121
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,800
of you knocking on doors in North Philadelphia trying to find the truth and eventually it

122
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,440
says here that Eugene Gillyard believed that a man who went by the name of Rolex was the

123
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,260
actual offender the one of the murderers of this shop clerk and it says that you went

124
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,360
to talk to Rolex and within minutes he had confessed to the crime.

125
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,240
How does that work?

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,960
Well every case is different every investigation is different.

127
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:15,440
When I investigate cases I think one of the strengths that we have is that I'm not looking

128
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:25,280
for a particular answer and I come off hopefully as relatively non-threatening and non-coercive

129
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,280
and just asking the witness you know if they remember the crime if they're willing to talk

130
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,200
and saying that I want to know the truth.

131
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,880
If the person whose case I'm investigating is involved I want to know that I want to

132
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,360
know that sooner rather than later and if he or she is not then of course I want to

133
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,920
know that information and so I'm really just trying to get the witness to open up and tell

134
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,600
me whatever he or she remembers.

135
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,280
Many many people are not willing to talk a lot of these cases bring up some significant

136
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,520
trauma for witnesses and victims and family members of the of the wrongfully convicted.

137
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:10,240
In that particular case I was fortunate in the fact that by the time I was face to face

138
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:19,160
with Rolex who was incarcerated at that time Eugene had already been in jail for this crime

139
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:26,880
for well over a decade and Rolex was ready to come clean his conscience had had caught

140
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,000
up with him and he wanted to do the right thing and so I was able to just give him the

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,080
platform that he was looking for to tell the truth.

142
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,240
It was like something that yeah I guess after that much time has passed this thing happened

143
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,800
almost a lifetime ago for somebody and like you said just the right person has to come

144
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,560
along with with the right conduit to make something right because I mean he I mean I

145
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,040
guess I just from my like five hours of watching that documentary I mean people can say all

146
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,600
kinds of things especially it seems like people who are in in law enforcement and prosecution

147
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,840
have such a caseload going on that you say you're looking for the truth it's almost

148
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,640
like they're trying to just process cases and get them done and check off some boxes

149
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,200
and it maybe seems like they take sort of a different tactic when they're talking to

150
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,760
some of these people and trying to not just like find the truth but almost just like get

151
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,120
work done.

152
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Is that something that you run across where I don't know if I explained that correctly.

153
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,600
No I think yeah there's been a lot of research done recently about different types of biases

154
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,880
that are present within many different stakeholders in the criminal justice system police prosecutors

155
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:50,640
defense attorneys witnesses victims and so one of the main factors that we are looking

156
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,520
at in the innocence community is confirmation bias that comes into play in a police investigation

157
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,600
and it's not in it's typically not intentional it's a very human way to process information

158
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,200
if you develop a theory or infer you know the first evidence that comes in points in

159
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:17,080
a certain direction you're going to naturally interpret additional evidence under that umbrella

160
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,680
so evidence that fits that theory becomes more important to you and evidence that doesn't

161
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,840
fit that theory you might subconsciously ignore and we see that a lot in police investigations

162
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,200
and in fact many police departments are now starting to train for confirmation bias to

163
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,680
teach officers that how this comes into play that it exists to be aware of it to try to

164
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
guard against that.

165
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,020
That's great and I saw that even they were talking about even with eyewitnesses that

166
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:52,640
one in four people looking through a photo book at a potential someone who committed

167
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,280
the crime that one in four people get the person wrong on photo identification and there

168
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,200
was all kinds of interesting science around that like if someone attacks you your brain

169
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,480
will naturally focus more on the weapon the knife or the gun or the fist or whatever and

170
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,760
that the face is just something that we as humans don't really process correctly especially

171
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,720
in a time of high stress and that when you're sitting down like all you want to do is make

172
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,280
sure that the person who's responsible for this is held accountable and so that's what

173
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,760
leads to all these I guess like bad witness identification cases.

174
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,240
Is that something you run across as well in some of the work you've done a lot?

175
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:43,120
Yes absolutely I have personally put on experts in eyewitness identification to testify to

176
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,760
pretty much exactly what you just explained and many other factors that we now know affect

177
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,440
the reliability of an ID.

178
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,040
Juries used to be presented largely with this person this eyewitness is either correct or

179
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:05,000
lying right now we know what the most likely answer is neither of those.

180
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,040
But there are many many genuine honest mistakes made by eyewitnesses due to a number of factors

181
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,400
you know you mentioned stress weapons focus our memory for faces in particular is not

182
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,400
as good as we thought there's also you know the time between witnessing the incident and

183
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,920
the first ID procedure multiple ID procedures can affect memory.

184
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,440
All of these things there experts have studied this intensely over the last few decades and

185
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:42,840
that has significantly changed both pretrial ID processes as well as post-conviction hearings

186
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,200
where we are looking at the reliability of an idea that was given a number of years ago.

187
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Gotcha.

188
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,920
One thing I was wondering about is with these new scientific concepts coming out there are

189
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,060
really two parts to this question one you seem to be and I think the Innocence Network seems

190
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:09,040
to be at the cutting edge of forensic science or whatever science might be involved in in

191
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,080
criminal law does that take a long time to propagate around the US to smaller communities

192
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,960
and things like that like if I went back to my hometown small town in Tennessee if I talk

193
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,800
to a lawyer there are they going to know about eyewitness problems and you know bite mark

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,200
issues things like that or is that does that take a long time to get out there?

195
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,560
Yeah I think it takes some time and some of these issues we've known about some of these

196
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,080
changes in science we've known about for longer than others and I do think that attorneys

197
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,360
with the Innocence Network when they get a case that presents this specific issue they

198
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,960
become an expert in that issue when you have an arson case when you have an eyewitness

199
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,000
case by learning from the experts right so we work very closely with researchers with

200
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,280
the fire investigators the experts who can teach us the science and then we do try to

201
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,000
pass that on as much as possible to the to the defense part in general through trainings

202
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,040
you know I think innocence attorneys in their home states are doing trainings to defense

203
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,240
attorneys all the time on these issues so I don't know the short answer to your question

204
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,400
is I don't know because but I think that there are significant strides being made in those

205
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
areas.

206
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,920
Cool and do you think that the bar for conviction is getting higher?

207
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,600
That is a really good question.

208
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:51,120
I would like to think so I think that the I think that people are still getting convicted

209
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,960
of very serious felonies on significantly less evidence than many people would think

210
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,080
would be necessary but I also think our criminal justice system is doing a you know every year

211
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,560
that goes by we're doing a better job of making sure that evidence put forth to a jury is

212
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:19,200
reliable both scientifically and in other fashions so I guess the best way I can answer

213
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,120
that is I think we're doing better than we were you know 10-20 years ago but there's

214
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,000
still significant room for improvement.

215
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,640
I guess along those lines too one thing that I was struck by when reading about some of

216
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,360
these cases is that you or someone else in your network will find compelling evidence

217
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,160
of someone's innocence whether it's a confession from somebody else there's DNA evidence that

218
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,100
says this person is eliminated as a suspect and might even say that this other person

219
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,760
is matched to it years can go by or a case will not be reopened because the original

220
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,880
prosecutors are unwilling to reopen it.

221
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
How does that happen?

222
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,440
Why does that happen?

223
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,520
I don't understand it.

224
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,280
Yeah there are a lot of reasons why it happens.

225
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:21,200
I mean one thing is that our criminal justice system that's often not always but often values

226
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,480
finality over justice so we have in every state is different but we have laws set up

227
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,880
to protect finality to make it particularly difficult to reopen cases.

228
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:48,480
In Massachusetts we're fortunate we have a very we have we have a post-conviction statute

229
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,240
that is intent on finding justice so in Massachusetts we can bring a new trial motion a motion

230
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,120
asking a judge to vacate a conviction at any time upon a showing that justice may not have

231
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,920
been done.

232
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,740
That's a statute that is aimed at finding the truth.

233
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,320
That being said there still can be procedural bars to reopening a case right if something

234
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,200
has already been litigated or if you don't have newly discovered evidence then you can

235
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,200
face procedural bars to getting back into court in Massachusetts and in other states.

236
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,880
I think the prosecutors again I think it comes back to often comes back to confirmation bias

237
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,360
that we talked about before right they still believe you know most prosecutors are good

238
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:46,560
people who want the right outcome but sometimes they are blinded by the fact that this person

239
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,120
was already convicted by a jury of his or her peers and it's really hard to see beyond

240
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,580
that at times.

241
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,940
That being said there is there's a movement in the innocence world led by prosecutors

242
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,900
to create conviction integrity units in their own offices where they themselves are reviewing

243
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,760
potential wrongful convictions to determine if they think that an injustice has been done.

244
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:24,940
So while we do face sometimes in our case work what I would view as unjust opposition

245
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,360
by prosecutors we also have had many cases where we work alongside the prosecutor to

246
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
try to come to the right result.

247
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,780
That's great I mean I think along the lines of confirmation bias imagine just even just

248
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,800
psychologically going into the office every day and having a team there that's dedicated

249
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,820
to the fact that we might get some stuff wrong relieves some pressure and also just lets

250
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,320
you think every day subconsciously there might have gotten one of these wrong so let's just

251
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
have that as part of the system.

252
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
I imagine that helps things out a lot.

253
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,920
It's good to hear that those are that those are happening.

254
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,960
So I wanted to mention too I remember I think it was two summers ago that we were golfing

255
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,440
and I think we were playing nine just a quick nine the sixth or seventh hole and you just

256
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,400
you got a phone call so I'm sorry I have to take this and then you got off and said yeah

257
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,600
one of my clients is getting released from prison today and you were like I'm so sorry

258
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,000
I have to go we're like yeah you can go we'll drive you if we if you need to.

259
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,640
Can you talk a little bit about that and just what it's like to go in and see one of your

260
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,280
clients be set free.

261
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,720
Yeah I mean that is bar none the best part of this job.

262
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:42,880
It's the day that you get to be with your client is as they walk out of prison that

263
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:51,200
particular client had served 35 years for a fire that he did not set.

264
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,520
It's hard to put into words what that feeling is like because it's incredibly tragic.

265
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:08,000
It's incredibly sad but also it's this it's this moment of pure joy when your client walks

266
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,200
out of prison into the sunlight into freedom for the first time in that many years and

267
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,680
what you and he or she have been working for together usually for most of our cases from

268
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,200
the from the day I get a letter from a potential client to the day that he or she walks out

269
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,440
of prison I think is averaging somewhere between five and seven years.

270
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,080
So we've been working together for a long time and working towards that day.

271
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,240
But there's always an undercurrent of tragedy as well.

272
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Yeah of course.

273
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,800
I mean this is you're someone who's been living for decades with an identity.

274
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,120
I mean if you're if you're convicted of a serious felony and you're living with that

275
00:24:52,120 --> 00:25:00,240
identity in a in a in a in a in a it's just false it's just wrong.

276
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,760
I can't imagine every day being saying that I have done this thing and you know you didn't

277
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
do it.

278
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,920
I even saw some of these cases where some of the wrongfully incarcerated were saying

279
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,280
I started to doubt myself.

280
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,200
Did I did I sleepwalk did I did something happen.

281
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,680
They almost start to believe these things that are being said about them.

282
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,640
But I mean I have to imagine that's a huge burden lifted when they walk out.

283
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,840
I did see that in a lot of these cases there's some financial compensation for the people

284
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
and it ranged.

285
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,120
I saw everything from someone got fifty thousand dollars a year for 10 years and ran out.

286
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,160
But then these people weren't eligible for Social Security.

287
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,860
So it's just that's a big hardship for them.

288
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,440
I saw another one where someone got 10 11 million dollars from the state of California.

289
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,960
What sort of that's what I was most interested I guess is what sort of support do these states

290
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,480
provide the people that come out and why and why is it so far ranging.

291
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Right yeah.

292
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:09,080
That's a really good question and it's a complicated answer because most states provide absolutely

293
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,560
nothing for exonerees immediately upon release.

294
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,480
And as opposed to somebody who committed the crime and gets released on parole that person

295
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,840
will have support state support from parole officers and and other ways.

296
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:35,120
But an exoneree typically gets nothing until he or she successfully litigates a civil compensation

297
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
suit.

298
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,920
So that's a separate litigation.

299
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,080
So you have you know all of your litigation in the criminal case is geared towards vacating

300
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,920
the conviction.

301
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,640
If you want any kind of state or federal compensation and those state statutes are all different

302
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,440
and they're different things you have to show to get state compensation versus federal compensation.

303
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,000
But you have to engage in a completely typically not every single state but typically you have

304
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,560
to engage in a separate civil litigation which again can be another one two three four years

305
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,380
until you see any money.

306
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:17,680
And if you do the range of that financial award as you just mentioned is significant.

307
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,260
So some states have a specific amount per year of wrongful incarceration.

308
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,980
Some do not some have a cap.

309
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,700
Some you have to show you have to prove innocence to a higher standard of proof than you even

310
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,500
had to in the criminal court.

311
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,520
So the compensation litigation is very complicated and not necessarily equitable.

312
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Gotcha.

313
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Well that's sad.

314
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:50,240
I mean I guess what it sounds like is this you talk to this new organization that's comprised

315
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,200
of people who were wrongfully convicted.

316
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,360
Is that a potential place for someone to go to work and make a living as part of that

317
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,040
as part of that program.

318
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:07,600
Well we have so at Life After Justice we have a branch of our nonprofit that is geared specifically

319
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
towards reentry of exonerees.

320
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,360
So to helping exonerees meet the many needs that they have upon reentry from incarceration.

321
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,440
You know those needs can be mental health.

322
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,200
That's what we focus on at Life After Justice.

323
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,600
But there's also just basic needs.

324
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,200
When you've been incarcerated for that long you need you need an ID.

325
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
You need a driver's license.

326
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
You need health insurance.

327
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
You need a job.

328
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
You need a place to live.

329
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,480
You need all these things immediately.

330
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,800
And there's a huge need for both you know innocence programs.

331
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,520
Most innocence programs attempt to help their clients with that.

332
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,920
And at BC we partner with the BC School of Social Work.

333
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,600
So we have social work students who are pursuing a masters help us draft our clients reentry

334
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,280
plans and then assist them with those needs.

335
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,600
But that's that's a big part of innocence work that I think the public often isn't

336
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,640
aware of how many needs exonerees have after they're released from prison.

337
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Yeah.

338
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,440
You mentioned students working with you.

339
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,240
How much of the innocence network is made up of legal students doing these sorts of

340
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
projects?

341
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
A lot.

342
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,080
I mean like I said each each innocence organization is different.

343
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,040
But I think I would say I mean certainly the three that I've worked with closely and I

344
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,840
would venture to guess most of them involve law student help to some extent or volunteer

345
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,120
help.

346
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,000
Many are not running actual legal clinics like we are where our students at BC are with

347
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,320
us for an entire academic year over 20 hours a week and they're receiving class credit

348
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
for that.

349
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,120
So we have a significant amount of our resources our students and I think some projects probably

350
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,640
use students a lot less.

351
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,320
But I think that they all involve law students or nearly all involved law students to some

352
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
degree.

353
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
That's great.

354
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:08,960
I guess from the perspective of a current high school student in the Concord area how

355
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,360
would they end up getting involved with the innocence network as a career if they want

356
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
to become a lawyer?

357
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,000
That's a good question.

358
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,080
I would say you know reach out to the innocent if you go on the network website the innocence

359
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,080
network website you can sort it geographically so you can see the projects in your area.

360
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,760
In Massachusetts we have three so we have the New England Innocence Project, the BC

361
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,080
Innocence Program and the Committee for Public Counsel Services has an Innocence Program.

362
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,520
But you can search it geographically and contact information for all the projects is on that

363
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:51,880
website and I've had a number of you know Concord, Carlisle high school students, graduates

364
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,080
and while in high school reach out to me for internships or questions and I think that

365
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,040
a lot of people can get involved that way.

366
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,520
One final question from the perspective of somebody digging this up in 50 years for the

367
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,880
300th anniversary where would you like to see our legal system go in the next 50 years

368
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,960
what can happen that would make you happy?

369
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,240
Wow that is a loaded question.

370
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,480
Yeah come here for the big ones.

371
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:32,320
Wow okay I think that I would like to see a shift overall to prioritizing truth and

372
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:48,160
justice over finality and having a higher standard of proof for convictions and a willingness

373
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:56,080
for prosecutors and defense attorneys particularly post conviction but somewhat pretrial to

374
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:04,320
be less adversarial and more collaborative in finding the most just solution for that

375
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,440
particular crime victim and defendant.

376
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,480
Great answer well handled.

377
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Good lawyer thinking on her feet.

378
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Well thanks again for joining me and this has been a very educational week for me and

379
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,120
it's been really cool you know you've been a friend for a while and just being able to

380
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,800
see more of what you do with your career is incredible and a ton of respect for you.

381
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Thanks again.

382
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:45,320
Good afternoon.
