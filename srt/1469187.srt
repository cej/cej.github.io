1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,340
Alright, this is Concord Storytellers and I am very excited for this episode.

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,480
We have with us Brianne Keith, a Concord expert and as we were talking before we started to

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,560
talk about it, it turns out we had an unknown convergence in life in the back bay as we

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,680
both went to college at the same time and lived within a block of each other.

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
So that's a funny coincidence.

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,800
I don't think we ran into each other during college, but here we are now in Concord and

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm excited especially for my cousin Amy back in Michigan who is an absolute fanatic about

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,320
ghosts and all things supernatural.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,960
Last time she visited me in Concord a couple years ago, she was excited to actually take

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,920
a ghost tour, but we didn't get to it and the next time she comes back she wants to

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,900
stay at the Colonial Inn and see if she can find anything supernatural.

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,320
So Brianne, could you please introduce yourself to our listeners?

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Sure.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:27,560
So I'm a writer, an author, and editor, that's my main thing, but I have been a thorough

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,840
enthusiast for years since I was 15 years old.

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,560
I turned it into a career.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,160
I was a thorough scholar for a number of years.

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:47,640
I worked with this scholar named Brad Dean who was the director of the Thorough Institute

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,520
and he published some late natural history manuscripts of Thoroughs and I sort of helped

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,240
him with that in later works.

21
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,440
I eventually just, you know, I've been a member of the Thorough Society, I was on the board

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:13,840
for years and I just sort of morphed into sort of being more interested in Thorough's

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,200
relationship to spirituality.

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:24,400
And so I eventually became a Jyotisha, which is a Vedic astrologer, so we can talk, I'll

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,920
talk about that in a little bit.

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,920
But I also worked for public media for seven years, WGBH, Boston's public media station,

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,560
which was really fun there, and I published a book in 2017 on American Lit called American

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Lit 101.

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,600
It's a trade book, so it's for the general reader, but it was kind of my love letter

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
to American literature.

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I love it.

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,080
What inspired you to write that?

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,960
Actually somebody approached me to do that, a friend from graduate school.

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,760
She was working at a publisher and she said this would be an amazing project for you and

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
will you do it for me?

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
I know you love Thorough and all that.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,520
So that's how that landed in my lap.

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Very cool.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Yeah.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,760
And so how did this, eventually you gave ghost tours at Inconquered?

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,320
Oh yeah, so for a while I was working for the Concord Tour Company, which was run by

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,440
my friend Alita, and I was assigned to the ghost tours.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,800
That became another sort of avenue of interest for me.

44
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,200
And yeah, so I have all the lore.

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Okay.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Right on.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Yep.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
That's cool.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,920
And what did you think when that was, I didn't know that was your assignment when you got

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,320
there, so that was suddenly something that you had to dive into and learn about.

51
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,520
And where was the information for this tour?

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,280
I can't take responsibility for it.

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
It was all Alita.

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,240
So she really did an amazing job.

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:06,200
She gave me like a 25 page guide on all of the lore that she could collect.

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,520
So I sort of just ended up studying that and that was the tour.

57
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,080
It was called the Ghosts in the Gloaming Tour.

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Okay.

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Like five or six stops.

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
I'm going to guess that was very popular.

61
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Yes.

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
It was, especially during Halloween and all that.

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Yeah.

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Okay, cool.

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,000
And could you walk us through some of the highlights from the tour?

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,040
Yeah, well, we all, I feel like most people kind of, the first thing they'll think about

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,800
with ghosts in Concord is the Colonial Inn.

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,320
One of the reasons is because Ghost Hunters came, I think it was like 2010.

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:48,600
So the inn got put on the map because of that and they didn't find anything, by the way.

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,340
But the story with the inn is interesting.

71
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:58,200
So during the Revolutionary War, one part of the structure was owned by a doctor, Timothy,

72
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm going to get his name wrong.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,340
Yeah, Timothy Minow.

74
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,680
And so his home became a makeshift hospital for the soldiers.

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,880
So room 24 was his operating room and then I think room 27 was his moor.

76
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,600
So that's where people think, okay, that's where this is all coming from.

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:30,720
There's also this other story about a colonial, a colonist, sorry, a colonist, Amy White, who

78
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,800
was the son-in-law of Timothy.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,800
And he supposedly went down to the battlefield, like when the battle was going on, with a

80
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
hatchet.

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Huh.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,680
And he killed one of the British soldiers that hadn't, you know, was shot, but wasn't

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
dead yet.

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,160
And so people did like, obviously there was a gruesome thing that happened.

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
So that just was a story that ended up kind of getting passed down.

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,000
So there's this, you know.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,640
So can I ask the question then?

88
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
So there's this battle.

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,600
So is this one of those things where like, if you're a townsperson, you say, hey, there's

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,320
this battle at North Bridge and this guy went down with a hatchet and hacked this guy up.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,600
And people are like, whoa, he kind of went a little too far with that.

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Yeah.

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
So it's like, okay, okay.

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
So that wasn't like, this was just part of the battle.

95
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,480
This was, okay, this guy was, that's a little too intense for what this was.

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Exactly.

97
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Okay.

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,560
So yeah, it's just, and so he just remained, his name remains imprinted in people's memories

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
for that.

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:39,080
But he, I guess there's a story that there's a red coat that appears at the bar at the

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,720
Colonial Inn asking for a drink.

102
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,520
And so people think it's the guy that got hacked by Ami White.

103
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,720
But I think that the biggest story is that there was a young couple that stayed there

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
on their honeymoon.

105
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,040
I think it was 1966.

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,120
And the bride ended up writing a letter to the innkeeper and saying, hey, you know, I

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
was there.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,040
I was, you know, I had this experience in room 24 where there was a gray shadowy figure

109
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,120
at the end of my bed and then it disappeared.

110
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,400
And so that was like the first kind of like, you know, documented.

111
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Yeah.

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Gotcha.

113
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Yeah.

114
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Yeah.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Interesting.

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,600
So we're definitely kind of testing my limits here.

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm going to tell you, I have to confess that when I was younger, growing up in Tennessee,

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
there was this legend of the bell witch.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,240
I don't know if you've heard of this pretty similar story about a family and someone kind

120
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,600
of went a little too far and started killing members of their own family.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,000
And there's this legend of the bell witch that if you say, I don't believe in the bell

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
witch five times in a row at midnight, that she'll appear and like scratch you or something.

123
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,040
It was terrifying to me as a kid.

124
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,520
And we went, I went with some friends very stupidly to the site of the bell witch house

125
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,320
late at night around Halloween one year.

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,880
And I just got the spooks, the hair standing up on my arms.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,440
I think that's might've might've been what caused me to retreat into science fields later

128
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,440
in life to to sort of say, okay, let me like analytically try to prove that none of this

129
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
is real to me.

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,920
But I also think that if I go to the Colonial Inn now, now that I know about room 27 and

131
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,840
about this British soldier that I'm going to probably watch my back a little bit more

132
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,320
than I have in the past when I go in there.

133
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,000
Just because in the back of my mind, there's this this experience I had when I was younger.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,760
I really feel like when I hear these stories, then I visit these places, it starts to literally

135
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,680
haunt me when I go there.

136
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Yeah.

137
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
How old were you again?

138
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,120
I must have been 14.

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,200
I was with my older sister and that crew.

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,520
So very impressionable and a little naive.

141
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,080
And yeah, it didn't go well for me.

142
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,480
I also can't watch scary movies anymore because of the movie.

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
Remember the miniseries with Tim Curry?

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Yeah.

145
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,920
So I thought I was cool with scary movies.

146
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,520
I wasn't cool with scary movies.

147
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I haven't watched one since I was like 15.

148
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Yeah.

149
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,520
My aunt used to take me and my cousins.

150
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
You know, she used to have us over for sleepovers.

151
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,360
And she's like a youngish aunt.

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,360
So she would show us the Freddy Krueger movies and then I would come home horrified.

153
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,360
My mother is so upset.

154
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
The cool aunt.

155
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Oh no.

156
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Devastating.

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yeah, I won't forget it.

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:36,240
And you said, I know you said that Ghost Hunters came in 2010.

159
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
So I haven't seen that episode.

160
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,040
Like what were they, what were they doing there to try to find, you said, try to find

161
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
something?

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,520
You know, I went in this rabbit hole of these Ghost Hunters shows because I use them sometimes

163
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,840
as like background noise or these like, you know, shows that have a similar thing every

164
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
time.

165
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,880
And usually they go in and it's that electromagnetic meter.

166
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Okay.

167
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
And sometimes they can catch voices.

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,400
So I think it's that tool, but they're just looking for like changes in that, you know,

169
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
the magnetic.

170
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm not a scientist, but they're looking for anomalies and sometimes they'll catch them

171
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
sometime.

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,280
And then they use photographs, they have special cameras.

173
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,040
And so, you know, sometimes they will pick up something like they definitely I've seen

174
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,880
shows where they have picked up shapes or like cloudy figures.

175
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,680
They're either like black or gray or some form of like, you know, like kind of a hazy

176
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
specter kind of thing.

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,840
Yeah, sometimes they'll move but but there was enough and maybe they caught some sound.

178
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,560
I don't really remember that episode.

179
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,480
But I know the end result was like, for all intents and purposes.

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,680
Okay, right on.

181
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Cool.

182
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Yeah.

183
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,640
And then I know I think you mentioned the Old Manse was another place that.

184
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, the Old Manse is so interesting to me.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,960
This that so that house, Nathaniel, the ghost story associated with that is that Nathaniel

186
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,360
Hawthorne lived there with his wife.

187
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,560
And supposedly there were two sort of things that were happening there.

188
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,880
And I was her Ripley, who was a met Concord minister that had lived there right before

189
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Hawthorne.

190
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:33,920
Basically, Hawthorne said that he could sense that he could feel his silk robes going through

191
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,280
the hallways, you know, pass by him and he could hear his voice and things like that.

192
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:50,640
And they also heard the noise of servants, like coffee grinding and I forget the other

193
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,280
sounds they heard, you know, just like work that ironing was the other one.

194
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,640
And then they'd wake up and none of that work was done.

195
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,160
So they kind of thought, OK, this is like the sounds of servants who have lived here

196
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,200
before.

197
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
And they were coming from the attic.

198
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
So the sounds are coming from the attic.

199
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,840
But, you know, Nathaniel Hawthorne was a very dreamy guy, like, you'd want to believe like

200
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,160
he is a supernatural, like he would believe in that.

201
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Yeah.

202
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,720
So well, that's interesting, though, because I mean, I think to me, I was thinking, OK,

203
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,640
well, if you hear some boards creaking or something else that you could explain with

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,920
the wind like that, that's one thing.

205
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,680
But if you're hearing more like coffee grinding is a different sound that's not happening

206
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
from the right.

207
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:44,280
One of the things I just want to say, like I had this sort of close friend 10, 15 years

208
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,880
ago, his father was an anthropologist and he did a lot of work in Italy.

209
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,400
And my friend said that he was working in the basement of these Roman churches and he

210
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,640
saw which he, you know, on more than one occasion, this line of men walking and they'd be in

211
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
rags.

212
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,880
And he ended up sort of coming up with the idea that these were actually Roman slaves

213
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,640
and they were coming in the Appian way, which was like one of the major roads into Rome

214
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,960
that this church was like built on or near something like that.

215
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,480
But his theory and I think this is like something that's shared with anthropologists.

216
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,800
You know, one of the theories is that when there's an event that happens in life, like

217
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,520
he did my friend described as like if I murdered you right now, like that was his example.

218
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,400
He's like this would leave a mark on this actual space.

219
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,760
And so you're seeing like this imprint of an event on the space.

220
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,840
So that I've always sort of like held that in my mind of like, okay, it's a theory, whatever.

221
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:00,080
But like maybe you're hearing remnants of something that was, you know, happened that

222
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,640
had some import to it.

223
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,160
Or makes sense.

224
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
So that's that's the story with that house.

225
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,440
But you know, it does that house is also interesting to me because of the ley line thing, which

226
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,240
I know you're going to talk about.

227
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,400
Yeah, you know, I'm interested to hear about that.

228
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,320
I think that was a whole new subject for me.

229
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,200
I think there was was there one more the the John Ball house.

230
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,840
Yes, so the John Ball house, that's now the Concord Art Association.

231
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
That's on Lexington Road.

232
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Okay.

233
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Right outside the rotary of the yellow house.

234
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,400
So that house was dates back to 1761.

235
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,480
And the founder of the Concord Art Association was a woman named Elizabeth Wentworth Higgins.

236
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
She moved there in 1923.

237
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,880
And so she the story is that she was depressed and she ended up hanging herself in the house.

238
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,800
And people that, you know, been in the house report a lot of coldness, like these cold

239
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,520
breezes that go by them.

240
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,520
And it was the house is interesting, too, because it supposedly was was one of the stops

241
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,440
on the Underground Railroad, which was discovered when they did renovation.

242
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,400
I forget what year it was in 1922.

243
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,600
And they found a secret chamber with like, you know, cannonballs and odd things from

244
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,960
from that century.

245
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:34,400
So the other thing that is interesting about that house is people reported feeling coldness

246
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,240
going in and out of the front doorway.

247
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Okay.

248
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,920
And then they did more renovations and they discovered a skeleton underneath.

249
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Oh, wow.

250
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, the doorway.

251
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Interesting.

252
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Yeah.

253
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Okay.

254
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Well, that's pretty chill.

255
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Yeah.

256
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Wait, wait.

257
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,720
So now that they've so I'm assuming they removed the skeleton when they did the revisions.

258
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,480
Yeah, I think so.

259
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Yeah.

260
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,880
Do we still feel like the chilly breezes there or is it just like it's mostly out of there

261
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
now?

262
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Well, I don't know.

263
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,080
I mean, I know Alita said people that are there now, like, don't want to talk about

264
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
it.

265
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Yeah.

266
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
They're just like, they're like, yeah, maybe.

267
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
But we don't want to.

268
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Yeah.

269
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Well, yeah.

270
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Well, maybe if, yeah, maybe like setting up a create like a good creative space on top

271
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,720
of it, something that culturally significant.

272
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,640
Maybe that can kind of just neutralize that a little bit and chill out the haunting effects.

273
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,880
And now that there's something good and community productive going on there.

274
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Yeah.

275
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,840
So maybe that's hopefully that's something that because I'm a little bit I want to be

276
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
able to go there in the future.

277
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,840
You're never going to forget this.

278
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
No, yeah.

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Basically.

280
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Yeah.

281
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Okay.

282
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Season.

283
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Yeah.

284
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
This is episode two.

285
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,120
I'm moving now.

286
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Cool.

287
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,840
Well, I really wanted to talk about lay lines because I looked into these a little bit and

288
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,760
I think you touched on this a little bit with this idea of it, by the way, to say if I merge

289
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,400
you right now, that would leave a question that would leave an impression on me as well

290
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,480
and make me think about that concept for a while.

291
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,640
So it sounded like that.

292
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,320
That sort of concept is what plays into this lay line theory.

293
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,240
So can you just educate me on this?

294
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Yeah.

295
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,680
Like, you know, I started hearing about them when I was doing tours.

296
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,560
So when I was like, you know, more like hobnobbing with the residents here and this and that

297
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,080
and the other tour guides, it just started being like this thing that would you hear

298
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
about.

299
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,200
I was like, what's lay lines?

300
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,680
And so, you know, I mean, all types of people, you know, just would say, oh, it's it's basically

301
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,320
there's a lay line that runs through the old man's in the old north bridge.

302
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,120
So I ended up kind of doing a little research on on them.

303
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:01,520
And I know that the, you know, the sort of the term lay line was coined by an amateur

304
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,720
archaeologist named Alfred Watkins.

305
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,480
He was looking at a map of all these ancient sites and was standing on a hill, like looking

306
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,720
at that map and he noticed that they were all on a straight line.

307
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,120
And so he said he had this like rush of insight that, you know, ancient peoples were like

308
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,480
building on some invisible line, maybe possibly.

309
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,640
But he like I did a little extra research on this and he, you know, he wrote a book

310
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,600
on this and he basically said, oh, they were just like, you know, trade routes that they

311
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,880
weren't, you know, there was nothing sort of mythical about them.

312
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:47,360
I don't think he was like sort of responsible for the mythical or supernatural, I guess

313
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,640
you could say, sort of interpretation of them.

314
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,120
But his idea that they were trade routes kind of got squashed, like because it didn't make

315
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
sense.

316
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,600
So I know in the 60s, other people kind of took up the idea, but it kind of resonated

317
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:10,040
with ideas that were already being like passed down, that ancient people were building spiritual

318
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,960
sites on energetic areas.

319
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,920
That the, you know, that there are certain areas on earth that have this, what are some

320
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,240
of the terms, rivers of supernatural energy.

321
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Okay.

322
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Okay.

323
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,580
So it's like these invisible rivers of supernatural energy.

324
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,000
The more I read about them or kind of like thought about them and the more of like my

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,240
own experiences with meditation or, you know, learning the Vedas and all this, is that they

326
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,280
might just, you know, if we go with this, right?

327
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Right.

328
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Yeah.

329
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,120
If we go, they might just be these areas where the other side is just more the veil, you

330
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,040
know, the, the, between that Austin, the other side here and the other side, it's just thin.

331
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,960
And so it's like, you know, these energies come in and out and it could be, I think they're

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,760
similar to the fairy paths in Ireland.

333
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Okay.

334
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,360
And you'll, if you do like a YouTube search, you'll see a lot of, you know, these Irish

335
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,720
farmers being like, oh, that's the fairy path.

336
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,480
And the story is about how that's where they live.

337
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,920
We don't, we don't, you know, bother them.

338
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,280
And, you know, if you, if you kind of stay in those areas, they'll come and kind of just

339
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
play with you.

340
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,560
So that's, that's kind of another thing that's related, you know?

341
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Yeah.

342
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Yeah.

343
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Do you have, have you noticed any, I'm just curious.

344
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,560
And the question that I had just now, is there, have you noticed any ties to like, maybe it's

345
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,000
a higher or lower elevation within a certain area or near a water source?

346
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,600
I know you had said sort of these like not physical rivers, but spiritual rivers were

347
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:03,360
just a, maybe a particularly peaceful place to be, or is there been any sort of geological

348
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,680
connection you found there, or is it purely just like, these people just felt like this

349
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,320
was the, it just felt like the right place, just purely spiritually?

350
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,520
You know, I was like, like I found an article on life science, like people had gone and

351
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,520
taken meters to magnet, magnetometers, found nothing.

352
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,920
Like, you know, they're, they're debunked that way.

353
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Yeah.

354
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,840
But they're, but then you'll see other people like with dousing rods and, and they go crazy

355
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,120
and those dousing rods are strange.

356
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,120
You know, I'm not sure how I feel about them, but they, you know, they, so you'll see that

357
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
happen, right?

358
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,160
And so, but no, I, I didn't see, I haven't seen like that, you know, these areas are

359
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
near water.

360
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:57,120
In fact, there's supposedly another ley line runs through Shelburne falls in Western Mass,

361
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,880
which happens to be the site of a Vipassana meditation center.

362
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Okay.

363
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,560
So that's kind of interesting, like why they are.

364
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Right.

365
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,120
And there's a, I just talked to my friend last night because he was talking about doing

366
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,640
this today and he's an acupuncturist in Rockport.

367
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,920
And he said, oh yeah, there's a ley line through Halibut state park and people from China come

368
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
to do Tai Chi there.

369
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Oh, no way.

370
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Yeah.

371
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,960
So it's kind of like this word of mouth.

372
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Yeah.

373
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
But it's fascinating.

374
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Yeah.

375
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,200
You know, and then the thing that I think is interesting about the old man's and then old

376
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,880
North bridge is like, these were really the sites of like this, I think they were highly

377
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,360
energetic sites in terms of like having historical significance and, and you know, ushering in

378
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
a revolutionary change.

379
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah.

380
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,880
I mean, and the butterfly effect is our world today is significantly defined by things that

381
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
happen there.

382
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Yeah.

383
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Yeah.

384
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
That's cool.

385
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Yeah.

386
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:09,320
And when I think about the role for Reverend Emerson, he, he, I think that Reverend William

387
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,400
Emerson, who's the grandfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

388
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,160
And when I think about him, sort of, you know, he was the, the conquered, he was conquered

389
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,640
town minister, like this figurehead and he sanctioned the war, which I think was that

390
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:32,360
really radical thing to do to say, you know, here's this man of the cloth and he's saying,

391
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,040
yeah, you should fight.

392
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Yeah.

393
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,480
So I think that's, it's like, I just think of him in that house, like kind of like saying

394
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,680
that and he was, he watched the fight.

395
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,480
He watched the shot heard around the world, like from his lawn.

396
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Yeah.

397
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I mean, yeah.

398
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,360
So for anybody who hasn't been to North bridge and old man's these, and we talk about these

399
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,080
as two separate historical places and conquered, but they are within a hundred yards.

400
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Yeah.

401
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah.

402
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,160
So if you, if you go visit the North bridge to see where the shots were fired, as you're

403
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,800
approaching North bridge from monument street, look to your left, old man says right there.

404
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,600
So if you were just making breakfast in the kitchen there, you looked out, you would see

405
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,240
this battle happening.

406
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,620
I mean, how would you know that it would spark what it sparked, but it, it was right there.

407
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,400
So it was a place for these people to observe it.

408
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Yeah.

409
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
It's very famous for it.

410
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Yep.

411
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
So yeah, I, I just, I don't know.

412
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,680
It's just an interesting thing.

413
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,880
It's part of conquered lore for sure.

414
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Yep.

415
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,560
People will, even if you just walked around today and they'd be like, yeah, I'm sure you'd

416
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,120
see, meet somebody and say, of course, you know.

417
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,080
So, so I mean, does that make it so for people who follow lay lines, I mean, you mentioned

418
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,120
Western Massachusetts, people will travel there to do Tai Chi.

419
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,200
Does that make so conquered obviously a historical destination, but also is this a spiritual

420
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,680
destination for people?

421
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Yeah.

422
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,080
And how, and how might we observe that?

423
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,840
If I go to old man's North bridge, might I see people like in groups doing Tai Chi or

424
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
meditation or something like that?

425
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,240
I think you, yeah, you might see that.

426
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,160
I think you see that more often at the pond.

427
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Okay.

428
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:23,120
Which probably Richard was just asking me this, this morning, my friend, he was asking

429
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
me, is that the same way line that goes through pot while in pond?

430
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,520
Because you know, he, he's, he has heard that there's one that goes through there.

431
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
So I think so.

432
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Okay.

433
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,800
We looked at a map, you'd probably see the line goes straight through them.

434
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,560
So you know, and we obviously know thorough treated that place as, you know, a secret

435
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
place.

436
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,520
So, um, uh, yeah, so that's cool.

437
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Yeah.

438
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
That's really interesting.

439
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Thank you for sharing.

440
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,480
Um, I'm gonna look into this more.

441
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Yeah.

442
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,960
Um, let's take a quick break.

443
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,320
And then I wanted to talk about Vedic astrology.

444
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Did I say it correctly?

445
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Okay.

446
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Okay.

447
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,280
We are back to discuss Vedic astrology.

448
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,360
And the reason we took the break is, um, we are going to do a live reading for me and

449
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,920
that involves some personal details that I didn't want to release to anyone listening.

450
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:23,560
Um, so I'm excited to hear this and a little nervous, but, um, tell me what we got here.

451
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Yeah.

452
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Right.

453
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
So I'll just preface what, what is, what is this?

454
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
What is Vedic astrology?

455
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,320
So I'll even step a little bit back.

456
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Like, you know, I obviously, you know, heavily involved in thorough and all his writings.

457
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Um, eventually, you know, at the first, I was sort of more interested in his, uh, social

458
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
commentary.

459
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:52,240
It morphed kind of when I was like late twenties into, um, more spiritual, you know, his, his

460
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,440
spirituality, you know, me sort of thinking heavily about, you know, deeply about that

461
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,640
and really being like attracted to his, uh, you know, relationship to the Vedas, which

462
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,400
is the ancient, um, Hindu scriptures, um, and really realizing that that was like the

463
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
fountainhead of a lot of what the transcendentalists were doing and thinking.

464
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,680
And so that just ended up morphing into me becoming, um, a Vedic astrologer.

465
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,200
It's a long windy path, but short, short, short and sweet.

466
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
The Vedic astrology is a branch of the Vedas.

467
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,360
It's basically one of the six Angas, which are limbs.

468
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,360
So the Vedas are, you know, these scriptures and then they have these explanatory limbs

469
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,920
and Jyotish, which is, uh, Vedic astrology is one of those limbs.

470
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,600
So it explains the astronomy and astrology of, you know, the cosmos, um, through, through

471
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,720
the Vedanta, through this, this philosophical principle.

472
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,960
So you know, we know astrology here in the West from a totally different vantage point,

473
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,200
you know, the Western astrology uses a different zodiac and, um, you know, this astrology

474
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,040
was really preserved in India, um, as well as it could be.

475
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,900
So there's a lot of things that are different.

476
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,440
So one thing that, um, people notice right away is their sun sign will be not what they,

477
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,880
you know, not what it is in the Western, uh, system.

478
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:28,280
So that's because, uh, Vedic astrology is using a stellar based zodiac, um, and it's

479
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,720
astronomically precise.

480
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Okay.

481
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,120
So the sun sign that I'll tell you that you are is, is actually like an astronomically

482
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
precise sun.

483
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay.

484
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,240
So if I'm hearing that correctly, I've always known myself to be a Virgo.

485
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Yeah.

486
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,560
That, how was that measured then from the Western viewpoint?

487
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,240
So basically there's, there's something called the precession of the equinoxes.

488
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,320
So the earth's tilt in relation to the sky changes a little bit over years.

489
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,560
Vedic astrology, the sidereal zodiac takes that into account.

490
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Okay.

491
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,640
Western tropical zodiac does not.

492
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,240
So all the signs right now have a 24 degree difference.

493
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,160
So some people will actually be the same sun sign that they are.

494
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:20,160
And you know, in what the Western zodiac astrology that they are and, um, in the Vedic, but,

495
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,920
but most people are pushed back as science.

496
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
So your sun sign is Leo.

497
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Oh, all right.

498
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Yes.

499
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
So you're Leo.

500
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Okay.

501
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Okay.

502
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
I like this.

503
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
I've kind of always wanted to be a Leo.

504
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
All right.

505
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Yeah.

506
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Yeah.

507
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Okay.

508
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Okay.

509
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
All right.

510
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
We're starting off.

511
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
We're starting off good here.

512
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
All right.

513
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
So yeah, you're, I'm going to pull up, uh, your chart.

514
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Um, so you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

515
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
you're, you're, you're, you're little birds on the 찍.

516
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,800
So, so the first fit, you know, the other thing about this is we're looking at your

517
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
karma.

518
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,780
So you have to kind of go, go with us just for this time, whether you believe in, you

519
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,000
know, you get the soul reincarnates or not.

520
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,080
That, that's what this is based on this, that you have reincarnated.

521
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Okay.

522
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,320
You have certain desires that compelled you to come back.

523
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,580
They're really looking at those desires.

524
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Okay.

525
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,580
Hold you back.

526
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,780
Um, and the map of, you know, there's there, uh, we read the maps.

527
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:19,100
map of them. And so, so if we look at your chart right away, actually I'm gonna hold

528
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:26,700
this down. So you are a Gemini ascendant. Okay. Okay. You and I actually share an ascendant,

529
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,860
so I can speak a lot about this. Okay. And you, within Vedic astrology there are these

530
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:39,740
little star clusters, so we look at the signs and we break them down into tiny subdivisions

531
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,900
called nakshatras, where there are these star clusters. They have a lot of meaning and actually

532
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,660
they are responsible for sort of initiating the karmic unfolding of your life. Okay. So

533
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,860
they're super important. So you're, the nakshatra that is at the top of your chart, your lagna,

534
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,660
is Arjuna. And I share this as well. Okay. So we have a lot of similarities. So Arjuna

535
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:12,460
is the symbol for Arjuna is a human head. Okay. It's a very mental nakshatra. So Einstein

536
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,820
also had this. Okay. Right? Just a person that is constantly thinking. Like they're

537
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,060
ahead. Like take, we don't even need a body. We could just like be ahead and thinking all

538
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,860
the time would be great. Prone to overthinking maybe? Yes, prone to overthinking, all that

539
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,780
stuff. Okay. So, so sorry, this is, this is what you were saying, this is what brought

540
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,100
me back. So this is like my natural state, my, my nature versus even my nurture. My nature

541
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:42,660
is overthinking. Okay. That's spot on. Yep. Yep. So, and, and really Arjuna is a very

542
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:50,020
destructive nakshatra. I will say that. Oh good. Yeah. So we want to, the impulse for

543
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:56,700
that, that nakshatra is to destroy anything that's not true. Okay. After truth. And actually

544
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,500
I of course looked up the Rose, the Rose chart and he has Arjuna prominent too. Oh nice.

545
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,980
Okay. So I could go on about that, but I'll, well let's, let's go over a little bit more

546
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,540
things, you know, things that are popping out here. So you have moon at the top of your

547
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,420
chart as well. Okay. So the moon is the mind. Okay. And so now if you have the moon at the

548
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:22,860
top of your chart, which correlates physically to your physical head. Okay. Your mind is

549
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,740
always on. Like your mind is very present in your head. And you're that nakshatra that

550
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:35,500
your, your moon is in is called Marigashira. And the symbol for a Marigashira is an antelope's

551
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:42,420
head. Okay. And the sort of mythology behind that is it's a seeker. Okay. So, you know,

552
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,860
like, like think of a deer, you know, just constantly running in the forest, like that

553
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:53,380
energy. So the mind is constantly seeking, seeking, you know, definitely a person that

554
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,700
would have many hobbies. So someone, so someone per se maybe used to be into engineering business

555
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,220
now is doing podcasting in a small town in Massachusetts. Okay. All right. All right.

556
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,820
All right. Okay. We're still on. We're still on. Yep. Okay. So now we take up tour to,

557
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,980
you know, and on the chart, we'll go to the second house. So you have Venus, Rahul, love

558
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:24,060
this. Okay. So, so Rahul is the north node of the moon. So Rahul is actually like your

559
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,860
destiny point. It's, it's wherever it is in a chart is saying, okay, this is where you're

560
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,940
going. Okay. This is like your chief impulse, your chief desire. So what is the second house

561
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,180
with, with Rahul there? Second house is speech. Okay. So it correlates, correlates physically

562
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,140
to the mouth. So like what we put in and out of the mouth. So if you have Rahul in the

563
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:52,980
second house, Rahul is also like endless cravings and desires, cause it's really pushing you.

564
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,660
It's it's fueling your drives and your desires and this, this incarnation. So you have that

565
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:08,700
drive and desire in the field of speech. Okay. You want to speak. Okay. You want to speak.

566
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:14,420
And so, and you have Venus next to Rahul. So Venus is going to give you pleasant speech.

567
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:21,940
Oh, okay. It's, you know, Venus is the planet of charm and grace and beauty and art. And

568
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,340
I know one of my teachers said, anytime you see somebody with Venus, Rahul, like what,

569
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:32,300
if they go into the arts, they'll flourish. Okay. So I'm giving you another career. Okay.

570
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,980
So interesting. So someone driven to speak, but also speak pleasantly and charmingly.

571
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,260
So I'll say that typically in my life, I've always been diplomatic. Like if I'm in a group

572
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:50,260
setting and there's an argument going on, my, my role tends to be to mediate, hear everyone's

573
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,260
everyone's thoughts, organize them and reach a group conclusion. I'm not someone who, I'm

574
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,220
not someone who will latch onto a point and just say, I must now win this argument. It's,

575
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
I've always been a diplomat. So is that, does that kind of jive with that?

576
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,420
Yeah. Venus is the planet of diplomacy. Okay. All right. It's a, it owns the sign Libra,

577
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,260
which is the scales, which is like, you know, interpersonal relationships. It's smooths

578
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:24,140
those, those, those kinds of, it's smooths relationships. Okay. It wants to create relationships.

579
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:33,740
Now your Venus is in the sign cancer. So there's a sort of nurturing aspect to that Venus,

580
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:41,420
the Rahu as well. Okay. Just looking what nakshatra is. So puna varsu is what your Venus

581
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:48,740
is in and the Rahu is in Ashlesha. So I'll say that Ashlesha is going to dominate that.

582
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:55,620
Okay. So Ashlesha is the symbol is a snake. And so Ashlesha energy is kind of like a snake

583
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:05,860
charm or energy. Oh no. It wants to mesmerize because it wants to sort of, it wants to kind

584
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,820
of raise the Kundalini and other people. If the Kundalini is the energy that goes up and

585
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,060
down the spine. Okay. So if you think of like the snake charmer, sort of making the snake

586
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,700
go up, like that's kind of physically what the Ashlesha energy wants to do to another

587
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,380
person. Okay. Is make them alive. So this speech that you have, like I think it's like

588
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,500
you actually want to sort of raise, let's say you want to raise consciousness with your

589
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,260
speech. Okay. Like it's not just, yes it's diplomatic, but you also kind of want to push

590
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:44,820
the needle forward a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say that's fair. At first when you were

591
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,860
describing that, I was like, wait a minute, am I like a snake charmer, snake oil salesman?

592
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,420
No. I wouldn't, as I wouldn't drive, but no, I get it. Yeah. No, that's, I would say that's

593
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,860
true. I like people to reach understanding, to continue to evolve as people, to continue

594
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:08,100
to learn new things. So, okay. We're still, we're still on. We're still on. So then you

595
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,340
have a packed third house. So you have sun and Mercury and Jupiter and your third house

596
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:20,660
is in the sign of Leo. So sorry, the first house was my nature. The second house was

597
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,420
my destination. What's the third house? Yeah. The third house and the second house is only

598
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,140
your destination just cause Rahoo's there. Okay. Oh, okay. So second house just in general

599
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,700
has to do with speech. Okay. Gotcha. And also your early life, it looks like your early

600
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,620
life was a little bit unusual. It could have had some unusual elements in there just because

601
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:46,940
Rahoo's there and Rahoo's unusual. So, yeah. Okay. Yeah. I won't dive too deep into that,

602
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:53,340
but yes, that's true. So, and it left a mark on you is really what the chart's showing.

603
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:00,540
So the sun, Mercury and Jupiter, that's okay. So the third house you're asking is about

604
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:07,220
communication. Okay. But more in the sense of like ideas. So second house is like just,

605
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:13,340
you know, speech. Yep. Like, but third house is like, what ideas am I communicating? Um,

606
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,340
and you've got three planets there. So there's a lot of energy in terms of like, I want to

607
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:25,420
communicate. Okay. Um, the sun is, you have a great sun. It's in, uh, it's in this nakshatra,

608
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:33,140
uh, poor Vipalguni. Okay. This, this energy of poor Vipalguni, uh, it's the, it's a lion,

609
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:39,700
lion type energy as all the Leo, but the symbol is kind of the main of the lion. So you'll

610
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:46,500
see poor Vipalguni strong and like Mick Jagger Madonna. Oh wow. Okay. Right. Like the performer.

611
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,300
Okay. Like, like it's all like it's, it's a, it's a pooba nakshatra meaning luxury.

612
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:59,940
Like, like there's a real desire to sort of have luxury, but also just present that. So

613
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,100
it'd be like, have fun, you know, like think of Mick Jagger on the stage. Like he's so

614
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:12,620
energetic. He's such a, you know, wild figure. Like that's poor Vipalguni. So like some,

615
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:22,540
so would that fit into, I'm someone who I don't need luxury, um, in my life. Um, that's

616
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:28,700
my point to the indoor sauna right behind me in my base, in my basement recording studio.

617
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:35,020
Um, but when I do indulge in something, I like to share it with my friends and my family.

618
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,140
Um, I won't, I won't necessarily do something luxurious for myself. I will, I will want to

619
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,860
share it. And that's absolutely true. Yep. Yep. Like there's, and you should, I mean,

620
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,340
this is like what you, this is why you came back is to experience luxury, you know, like

621
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,420
that's, you want to sort of, there's no like judgment on, you know, it's like this system

622
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,220
really allows you or like teaches you to just not have any judgment on people's like, you

623
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,420
know, there's a desire they had to, when they came back, they want to experience that. So,

624
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:12,220
um, the sun is next to Mercury and this is, this makes for an intellectual lifetime. Okay.

625
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:17,420
Cause Mercury's, uh, you know, the planet of the intellect, different than the mind.

626
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,100
So there's a definite distinction within the Vedas even that the, of the Mercury and of

627
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:29,300
the mind being, you know, there's different natures of mind. Okay. Um, so the Mercury

628
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,260
is like the, the, the sort of impulse to sort of categorize things and make distinctions

629
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,980
and you know, measure things like the, it's a science, it's the intellect or scientific

630
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,580
mind. So you've got that, you know, you've got Mercury next to suns, you know, so sun

631
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:51,780
is sort of like infusing that Mercury, that intellectual, that intellect with its energy.

632
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:59,060
So it makes for a very, um, like I said, just an intelligent, very intelligent, but also

633
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,580
intellectual lifetime. So it's also Mercury is also important for the planet. Okay. Wow.

634
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,780
Well, that's interesting. I, I'm not going to speak to whether or not I'm an intelligent

635
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:15,580
person. I do get made fun of for all the spreadsheets I make. Right? I have a spreadsheet for pretty

636
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:23,100
much everything. Yeah. You also have, you have, um, you have three planets in poor Rufa'l

637
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,460
Gouni. Is that odd or rare? It is a little odd. Okay. It's a little rare to have them.

638
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,220
Oh gosh. You have something called a planetary war. I just picked up. Okay. So Mercury and

639
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:41,820
Jupiter are at the same degree in your chart. Very interesting. Okay. So, so when the planets

640
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,220
are at the same degree, it's called a Graha Yudha. So it's a planetary war. So those,

641
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,780
those, the rays of those planets are intermingled. So there could be a struggle between the two

642
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,180
energies. What's, what are the two energies? Mercury wants to say, Mercury is more like

643
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,100
morally neutral and sort of just wants to say, these are the facts and this is like

644
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,100
the information, right? Jupiter said, no, I, I want to, I want to have wisdom, you know,

645
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,020
like I want to understand the wisdom behind this. You know, there's a higher sort of moral

646
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,180
principle. So there could be a push and pull between that. Okay. You know, like here's

647
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,380
what my intellect says. Here's what my higher mind says. That's more, you know, um, you

648
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,900
know, for you, the Jupiter rules, the seventh house and the 10th house. So this could come

649
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,020
out in, um, this could actually come out. Your mother could be involved in this, um,

650
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:42,860
because she's represented by Mercury in your chart. Okay. And so she could kind of, you

651
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:51,260
know, she could butt heads with maybe, um, your partner or, or your, or somebody in your

652
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,620
workplace. This doesn't always have to be that, but, um, but I will say your mother

653
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,020
looks interesting in this chart because she, first of all, she's sitting at the top of

654
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,260
your chart. She's the moon. So she's right on your head all the time. Okay. Well, we're

655
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,340
still, we're still pretty spot on. All I'm hearing, what I'm thinking is I'm thinking,

656
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:18,680
maybe this is the source of any anxiety in my life. Yeah. I don't know that like someone

657
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,160
who I get from, from the birth, I guess, who's an overthinker, but then also has a conflict

658
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,420
between like, I guess, like the factual choice and the higher sort of the higher moral choice.

659
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,860
Yeah. I get stuck a lot. Yeah. I get stuck a lot when I'm making choices sometimes. Yeah.

660
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:43,300
That makes sense. Yeah. And, and, but you know, you have the, the, the mother influences

661
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:51,060
strong when you see that in the first house. So like, I think that, you know, that's influencing

662
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:58,220
your mind as well. So, um, but this is a very intellectual chart. I mean, this is, this

663
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:06,020
is an intelligent person. Wow. Is that, is that rare also? Or is that, yeah, like you

664
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:12,220
don't always see, okay. See prominent third house moon at the top, Gemini, Ardress, and

665
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,900
then all those things that I mentioned. Okay. So interesting. I mean, yeah, again, I won't,

666
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,100
I'm not going to speak to whether I'm intelligent. People will argue that I've heard, I've heard

667
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,860
both sides of that coin for me. I will say like, so there's another interesting part

668
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:35,300
of this system, which is the timing of your life. Okay. So these maharishas, um, you're

669
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:41,420
in a Saturn maharisha. So you've been in one since 2015. So you might've noticed that year

670
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:48,620
being, um, you know, memorable for some reason, because you shifted into like a new period,

671
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:55,900
the Saturn periods, 19 years. Um, and you were previously in a Jupiter period from 18

672
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:02,300
to 34. So those years were really marked by, you know, you know, you're out looking for

673
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,100
information, like you're, you're seeking information, you're learning all that stuff. But Saturn

674
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:14,340
here is in the fourth house. So this is more about home. There's an emphasis on home. Um,

675
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,060
you know, even thinking about home, you know, your home place, but establishing a home and

676
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,700
all that stuff. Um, so you're building, these are kind of building yards. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

677
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:32,980
Yeah. That's spot on. Um, well, let me, let me skip to the, the, the, the anxious part

678
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,620
for me. What's in my future. Yeah. What's in your future? Um, let me see where you are

679
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:45,580
right now. You're in a, uh, you're in a Saturn Venus period. So interestingly enough, you

680
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:51,340
know, we were saying the Venus Rahu is making you, you have desire for speaking. And so

681
00:45:51,340 --> 00:46:00,620
since 2021, you've kind of that, that area, right, has gotten highlighted. So this sort

682
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:07,180
of the podcasting or whatever, like maybe you started germinating around then, um, but

683
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,620
you're going to really hit a stride. You're in the middle of it and you'll get, uh, the

684
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:19,500
end of it is February of 2025. Wow. Right. When this was sort of, it's going to wrap

685
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,580
up. Interesting. No, that is interesting. I mean, just from, from my point of view,

686
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:29,020
um, the way my life has evolved, um, you know, I was an engineer, I was in engineering and

687
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:34,900
business for, I call it phase one of my career. Um, we're almost starting a therapy session

688
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:41,140
now. No, no, it's cool. I think we should, we should air it. I think this, I think that

689
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,340
hearing someone have insight into this could then maybe someone listens and says, Hey,

690
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,500
maybe you want to try this out to see if I can organize thoughts about my own life. But

691
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:54,660
when I was in engineering and business, I think, you know, I was really tapping into

692
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:00,620
my desire to create things, build things, make things that help the world. But when

693
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,140
you're a builder, you tend to be more of a back room person. You're not, you're spending

694
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,140
all of your time doing that. You're not out like talking, interacting with people as much,

695
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:17,060
which I really enjoy as well. Um, so I think that when I, when I stopped working in engineering

696
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,540
and business worlds, I took me a couple of years to figure out what I wanted to do with

697
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,860
my life next as sort of a next career or next major hobby, whatever this might end up being

698
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:32,300
and doing something like this, where I'm actually talking and speaking to people, being out

699
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,820
the more of the Mick Jagger role of being out front and center and sharing stories with

700
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,300
people became very attractive to me, not just because it's something I've always liked doing,

701
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,860
but it was kind of something I missed out on during that first phase of my career where

702
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:52,620
it was necessary for me to be in a different role. Um, so wow, that's cool. And by the

703
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:58,900
way, Venus also rules math. Okay. So it's not just art. It's also like, it gives art,

704
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,100
you know, if you have a Venus, Rahul, it's also going to give you mathematical aptitude.

705
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:08,820
Okay. So it's just, you can choose, right? So you're just, you're like, Hey, you get

706
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,020
three planets in the third house of communication and a very showy nakshatra. You want to get

707
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:18,100
out there and you actually want to, like I said, that Venus Rahul, you want to rate in

708
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,780
the Ashley and you know, Rahul and that you want to raise people's consciousness. That's

709
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:28,980
really kind of the angle. You know, when you get out in February of next year, that's when

710
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:34,660
you get into your son sub period. When you get into these sun sub sub periods, their

711
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,940
career making there, it's like when you're more visible in the world. Okay. So you can

712
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:45,460
expect, you know, you have a good year next year where you'll be more notice. Okay. All

713
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:51,060
right. We'll see. We'll have to revisit in March and see what, see what, see where we

714
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:57,460
are. Exactly. We will revisit. Cool. Well, this has been, this has been awesome. I can't

715
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,580
tell you how much I appreciate you coming. Um, and I just, it's incredible. The career

716
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:08,580
you've had with such a broad range of interests. And I can imagine that as a writer and creative

717
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:15,940
artist that having this just wealth and breadth of interests and historical backgrounds has

718
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,140
been led to like a really fun career for you. Yeah, it really has. I'm a little bit of an

719
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:27,300
oddball, but I'm happy for it. We like that in Concord, Massachusetts. Right. So yeah,

720
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,380
thank you so much. Thank you. Um, and yeah, I'd love to have you back again sometime too

721
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:38,980
to chat. Thanks, Brianne.
