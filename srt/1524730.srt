1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,040
Alright, welcome to Concord Storytellers and making a return visit this time, Richard Smith,

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
local historian, Henry David Thoreau expert.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,500
And we were talking and thought it'd be a lot of fun to dive deep on something we touched

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,320
upon briefly in the Thoreau episode.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,520
And that was just what were people like in Concord in the 1850s, 175 years ago.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,120
And it turned out Thoreau himself had written journals about his everyday interactions with

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,080
people, his everyday goings on.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,240
People were different in a lot of ways in the 1850s, but people were also similar in

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,480
a lot of ways in that they were just doing their jobs every day, talking to neighbors,

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,040
seeing what people were up to, gossiping a little bit, talking trash about some people.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:02,080
So I found it, I wouldn't say it's my favorite book I've ever read, but it has a solid 3.5

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,440
on Goodreads out of five stars.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
I think that's appropriate.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
It's a good book.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
It's a good book.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
But it's interesting.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,200
And for those of you that are wondering what book we're talking about, it's called Men

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
of Concord.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,040
And it came out way after Thoreau died.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,320
Thoreau died in 1862.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,380
This book came out in 1936 and was actually the brainchild of N.C. Wyeth, the artist.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,380
He loved Thoreau.

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,760
He was obsessed with him.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,280
You could say that Thoreau was his spirit animal.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,620
And so he always wanted to do some kind of a book about Thoreau, maybe using journal

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,000
entries and illustrating it.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,480
And he started thinking about this like in 1918.

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:53,520
But it didn't happen until about 1930, 1934, when an editor at Houghton Mifflin named Francis

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,640
Allen, who had worked on Thoreau's journals in 1906, he got together with N.C. Wyeth and

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,340
said, let's do this book.

31
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,840
So he chose the journal entries that was going to go into this book.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,800
Wyeth did the illustrations for the book.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,040
And it came out in 1936.

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:21,200
And to a lot of Thoreauvians, yeah, it's kind of it's Henry kind of dish in the dirt and

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,040
talking about the people he knew, the famous people, the not so famous people.

36
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,200
And his journal is wonderful.

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,520
If you just read it, it's like an everyday snapshot of Concord in the mid 19th century.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,200
And so what Wyeth and Allen did was they kind of got what they thought was the best little

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,380
bits from Thoreau's journal.

40
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,280
And they put it into this book in 1936.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,640
And I think the more time goes on, the more interesting it gets, right?

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,760
Because the more everyday culture diverges from what it was like in the 1850s.

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Absolutely.

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,240
And we were talking about before about how, at least from my perspective, growing up,

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,560
history is always very nobelized.

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,440
These noble virtues and these great historic things that happens tends to be a very serious

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,240
topic when you're talking about history.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Sure.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,120
And the presidents and senators and generals and leaders and great men, of course.

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,800
You're not talking about what Chris Johnson and Richard Smith's of the day were doing

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
every day in their lives.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,320
And I mentioned too that I think about 20 years ago, there was an ancient Greece and

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,200
Rome exhibit, the MFA.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,800
And this switch just clicked in me when I saw I got past all of the weapons and all

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,720
that and I saw graffiti from ancient Rome and I saw a weapon from ancient Greece, but

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,680
it was a stone that was meant for a slingshot and it had written in Greek on it, eat this.

58
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,000
And I just thought, that's cool that people had, they had humor, they had jealousy, they

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,880
had all these emotions that we have, of course.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,880
You would figure they do, but to see it put into context of those times is really interesting.

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,720
And I thought that a good way to do this would be to just go through some of our favorite

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,680
passages in this book.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,680
And again, to reiterate, in Thoreau's time, if he had published this right as he was writing

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,520
these things, this is like me showing you my journal and saying, I did a Starbucks run

65
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
today.

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
I played nine holes of golf.

67
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Well, it's like Facebook.

68
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah, exactly.

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,120
You go on Facebook and you see the minutia of everybody's lives.

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh, we saw the black bear in the neighborhood this week.

71
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,800
I mean, that's exciting.

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
That is exciting today.

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,920
But a lot of this stuff is just going to go right over your head, but as time goes by,

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
it'll become more interesting.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,600
And I wonder 175 years from now what people will think about us.

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,640
And they say, okay, there's some everyday things they did, but those barbarians used

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,880
to eat animals or something like that.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
I can't believe they used chemotherapy.

79
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
What was wrong with these people?

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,960
Yeah, I mean, just there's going to be stuff that makes us look barbaric.

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:13,520
Well, it's interesting because about about 20 years, not even after Thoreau died, there

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,560
were some people who are actually interested in maybe publishing selections from his journals.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,880
And people went around Concord asking, well, you know, would you be interested in reading

84
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
Thoreau's journals?

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,240
And the famous story is one of Concord's town leaders said, why would anybody want to read

86
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
that stuff?

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
I mean, who really cares?

88
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,060
You know, and so here it is 100 years later, 150 years later.

89
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:49,040
And for me in particular, I probably read Thoreau's journals more than I read the stuff

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
that was published while he was alive.

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
You're getting the real person.

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,760
I mean, we're so lucky from the 19th century, all of these people, Emerson Thoreau, Margaret

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,280
Fuller, whomever you're talking about, Bronson Alcott, they all kept journals.

94
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,320
And it's the daily minutiae that that as a historian that I really like, because especially

95
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,320
when it comes to Thoreau, it really brings him alive.

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,400
You see what he likes, you see what he didn't like.

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,680
He and Emerson would sometimes get bitchy about each other in their journals.

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,680
And he would talk about people that he knew, people he didn't know.

99
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,280
And you like I said, you really get this little snapshot of mid 19th century Concord.

100
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,200
Yeah, exactly.

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,920
It animates that very stuffy portrait that you see of Thoreau and Emerson, for instance.

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,280
I do want to offer a disclaimer that we're not skipping anything here.

103
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,800
Not all of this is going to be PG.

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,960
It's from the 1850s, so it's not it's not going to be anything as near as shocking as

105
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,040
you can read in 2024.

106
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,400
But we're just going to go through and read some of our favorite snippets and react to

107
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
them.

108
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
We haven't shared with each other which snippets we bookmarked, but I thought we would just

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,960
go through and see some of them.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,200
And I know that you've known these stories for a long time, but they were new to me.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,680
So there are some pretty, pretty cool and shocking stuff in there, including the smack

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,400
talk and quite a bit about everyday hygiene in the 1850s.

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
That shocked me.

114
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
Yeah, well, can you find that one?

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,880
And we will you can read it and we'll talk a little bit about that because, yeah, by

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,920
the mid 19th century, they weren't as fastidious as we are today.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,680
Nowadays we tend to be overly sanitized.

118
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,720
And that's that's not something you can say about people who were living in the mid 19th

119
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,560
century or even before.

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,960
Yeah, I think I might have to get to that one a little bit.

121
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,840
My bookmarking technique here was basically just scrap paper and I have to go I have to

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,760
go in kind of chronological order through the book.

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Oh, sure.

124
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Let's do that.

125
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,200
Why don't we just go back and forth with some of our favorite passages and I'll start

126
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,740
early in the book around page 17.

127
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,000
They liked a good fire back in the day.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
And there's an entire passage here.

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,160
June, June 4, 1850 said, Today I've been tending a burning in the woods.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Ray was there.

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,560
There's a pleasant fact that you will know no man long, however low and social scale,

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,120
however poor, miserable, and temperate and worthless he may appear to be a mere burden

133
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
to society.

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,000
But you'll find at least that there is something in which he understands and can do better

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
than any other.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,800
And getting into that he's maybe not a fan of Ray.

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,080
I was pleased to hear that one man had sent Ray as the one had had the most experience

138
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,560
in setting fires of any man in Lincoln.

139
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,400
He had experience and skill as a burner of brush.

140
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,520
So great admiration for a man who can set a good fire.

141
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,200
Well, it's funny because that that was an important thing to know how to do.

142
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,600
You had to have somebody who knew to do things like that.

143
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,680
There's another journal entry where Thoreau talks about his mom and she remembers growing

144
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:04,360
up over on the Virginia road and she would hear a neighbor from a long distance away

145
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,160
whistling and he was known in Concord as being an admirable whistler.

146
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,440
So yes, you've got the admirable whistler.

147
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,400
You've got this guy who's the admirable burner of brush.

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,440
There's another guy that Thoreau writes about how he was really good at slaughtering pigs.

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,960
You know, they've all got these little things about them that sets them apart.

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,840
So you see the guy walking down the street you're like, well, that's the burner of brush

151
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
over there.

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,600
I mean, it seems in these days there aren't there's not a massive AT&T, GE, Google, Apple,

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,000
where you have thousands of people working at these companies.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
People have very specific skills and trades.

155
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,200
And I feel like that that came out to me as people admired someone who had mastered something,

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
however small that that skill may be.

157
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Absolutely.

158
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
There were people in the 19th century.

159
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
You knew who the best cobbler was.

160
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,540
You knew who the best blacksmith was.

161
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:09,520
You knew the guy to go to if you needed a horse broken or something like that.

162
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,240
These were everyday skills.

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,280
And it's not like you went to school for any of this stuff.

164
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm sure this guy didn't go to Harvard learning how to burn brush.

165
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,480
It was just something that he had done time and time and time again until he got really

166
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
good at it.

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,280
And Thoreau really admired those kind of things in the everyday people.

168
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:37,000
He liked the muskrat hunters and the brush burners and the people like that because he

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,480
liked the folks who had a trade.

170
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,900
They were using that trade.

171
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,160
They were making a living doing it.

172
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,880
And to him that was like good, honest, hard labor.

173
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,360
And he absolutely admired those kind of people.

174
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
That's cool.

175
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
What do you got from your first passage?

176
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,600
OK, so Thoreau briefly lived in New York City in 1843.

177
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,000
And when he was there, he became friends with Horace Greeley, the editor of the New York

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Tribune.

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,880
And after Thoreau came back to Concord, Greeley was always trying to get him to write about

180
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,280
the famous people that he knew.

181
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,720
He's like, look, you know Emerson, you know Hawthorne, you know Bronson Alcott.

182
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,200
If you write essays about these guys, I will publish them and get them published for you.

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,140
And Thoreau, he wanted nothing to do with it.

184
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,080
But he did write stuff in his journal.

185
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,520
And I tend to think that these are pieces that he was jotting down for possible publication.

186
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,280
So this is from sometime between 1845 and 47 about Ralph Waldo Emerson.

187
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,680
Emerson again is a critic, poet, philosopher with talents not so conspicuous, not so adequate

188
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,040
to his task, but his field is still higher, his task more arduous.

189
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,160
Lives a far more intense life, seeks to realize a divine life, his affections and intellect

190
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,040
equally developed.

191
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,320
He has advanced farther and a new heaven opens to him.

192
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,080
Love and friendship, religion, poetry, the holy are familiar with him.

193
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:25,920
The life of an artist, more observing, not so robust, elastic, practical enough in his

194
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,200
own field, faithful, a judge of men.

195
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,920
More of the divine realized him than in any.

196
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,360
A poetic critic reserving the unqualified nouns for the gods.

197
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,040
So he's obviously jotting down, it's very free form, almost like he's just kind of writing

198
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,320
down what he thinks about Emerson.

199
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,720
He did the same thing for Bronson Alcott, but he never had those things published.

200
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,520
He's kind of toying with the idea.

201
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,240
And this was 1845, 1847, about the time that he was living at Walden.

202
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,500
He probably wrote this when he was at Walden.

203
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,680
He still is getting along with Emerson.

204
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,400
They were still very good friends.

205
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,440
And you can see in this young, he was like about 28 to 30 when he's writing this.

206
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,120
And he's still kind of enamored by his friendship with this guy.

207
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,200
Here's this guy who's letting me live on his land at Walden Pond and he's this amazing

208
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
person.

209
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Right.

210
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
So he's, modern day publications, he's writing about Emerson for the New Yorker.

211
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
And he gets the TMZ.

212
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Right, exactly.

213
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Exactly.

214
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah, this isn't quite the dirt yet.

215
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,940
And then a little bit later in his life, to continue that thread.

216
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,840
So in 1858, Emerson and a bunch of other writers and philosophers went to the Adirondacks for

217
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,320
a couple of weeks.

218
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,140
And they were camping and hunting and stuff like that.

219
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,320
And Thoreau thought it was absolutely ridiculous.

220
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:14,360
And so from 1858, he writes in his journal, Emerson says, this is from August 23rd, 1858,

221
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,080
Emerson says that he and Agassi and company broke some dozens of ale bottles, one after

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,000
another with their bullets in the Adirondack country, using them for marks.

223
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,560
Think of Emerson shooting a Pee-Wee for Agassi and cracking an ale bottle with his rifle

224
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,280
at six rods.

225
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,600
So he's just amazed that Emerson is out there shooting guns in the Adirondacks.

226
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
And he finds it finds it to be absolutely ridiculous.

227
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I love to hear it.

228
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,400
So I want to get so I think showing that he had the ability to trash talk a little bit

229
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,360
eight years prior in 1850, he describes he seems to have a fascination a bit with drunk

230
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,840
people, a drunken Dutchman.

231
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
It's a good story.

232
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,040
It's a good story writing about drunk Dutchman.

233
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Yeah.

234
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
And I just I'll read it's a long passage.

235
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,960
I'll just read a snippet from it.

236
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,840
He says, I was less disgusted.

237
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,400
I was less disgusted by their filthiness and vulgarity because I was compelled to look

238
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,000
at them as animals, as swine in their stye.

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
For the whole voyage, they lay flat on their backs on the bottom of the boat and Bilgewater

240
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,600
and wet with each bailing, half insensible and walling in their own vomit.

241
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,360
So admiration, disgust, what are we feeling here from from his his description of the

242
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,400
drunk Dutchman?

243
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:45,160
So thorough was a bit of a prude when it came to drinking and stuff like that.

244
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,160
It's funny because a lot of times when I'm talking to older, older folks who grew up

245
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,040
in the 60s, they say stuff like, oh, I'd love to sit at Walden Pond with thorough and smoke

246
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
a joint.

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Yeah.

248
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,800
And I'm like, yeah, you're totally barking up the wrong tree with this guy.

249
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:11,560
But thorough, he he was kind of a prude when it came to to drunkenness, to bad behavior,

250
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,280
to people who were acting less, who were acting pretty uncouth.

251
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
And that's what he saw in these people.

252
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,200
Yeah, he's kind of turned off by and disgusted by this.

253
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:31,360
There's another instance where he was going to, I think, down to Hingham on a boat.

254
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,960
And there were young Irish boys who were smoking and swearing and being really loud and obnoxious.

255
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:47,040
And he writes in his journal, I thought of infanticide among the Chinese with some complacency.

256
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,000
And he was completely appalled that these 12 year old kids were smoking and being really

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
rude.

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He thought it was disgusting.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,640
So I think it really bothered him when he would see people not living on the higher

260
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,600
plane that he expected of human beings to do.

261
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,840
You know, here's thorough, who's kind of living this life.

262
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:14,040
He's trying to always be the best person that he can be and live on a higher level of consciousness.

263
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
And he sees things like this.

264
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,240
He's thinking, God, what's wrong with these people?

265
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,920
He feels a bucket.

266
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
He absolutely did.

267
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah, sure.

268
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Yeah.

269
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,120
And he's kind of a prude New Englander.

270
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah.

271
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
OK.

272
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,520
And our reputation is well earned and steeped in long tradition.

273
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Absolutely.

274
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,200
And so he sees people not acting the way he thinks people should act.

275
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,560
And it really bothers him when people are put down to the level of, what did he say,

276
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
animals?

277
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Yeah.

278
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Yeah.

279
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
He wasn't disgusted by them because he didn't view them as human.

280
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
He viewed them as animals.

281
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Yeah.

282
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Yeah.

283
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,080
And he's very prude, very judgmental.

284
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah.

285
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,120
And you just want to be like, dude, mind your own business.

286
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah.

287
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,040
I mentioned I'm going to do two because this one is kind of related in terms of people

288
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
being.

289
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,560
Well, this one is actually something that's directed at him.

290
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,400
But there's this visitors to the Walden hut, January 17, 1852.

291
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,040
And it seemed like I noticed that it seemed like it was a thing to do during these times

292
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,520
to just stop by somebody's house, even if you didn't know them and just ask for water.

293
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
There's no Starbucks runs.

294
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Right.

295
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Yeah.

296
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
So you just stop by and ask for water.

297
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,800
And he said, I don't have any cold water, but I lent them a dipper, which I don't know

298
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
if it's like a ladle, like a ladle.

299
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,520
So we could go maybe go to the river or pond or whatever and grabs some water.

300
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah.

301
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,960
Well, it turned out that they didn't even really want water.

302
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
They just wanted to steal the dipper.

303
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,560
So they just ran off with it.

304
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,920
Were these the two women?

305
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
The two women, the two young women.

306
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Yeah.

307
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Sure.

308
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
You know this story.

309
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Yeah.

310
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Yeah.

311
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
He was appalled.

312
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,640
He was appalled that these two women borrowed the dipper and they disappeared with it.

313
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Yeah.

314
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,720
And they never came back, which, you know, when he was living at Walden pond, it kind

315
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,280
of became the thing.

316
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
Let's go down and see what this guy is doing down there.

317
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,880
And so unfortunately, these two women are lost to history.

318
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,320
We don't know if they were Concordians.

319
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Maybe they were visiting Concord and somebody said, oh, you should go down and see the hermit,

320
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,520
quote unquote, of Walden pond.

321
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,080
But yeah, they stole his dipper.

322
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,880
So they might have just been playing a prank on him or something.

323
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Could have been doing that.

324
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
It was like almost there.

325
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
Maybe they were dared to go.

326
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Absolutely.

327
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,080
To steal something from the hermit or whatever.

328
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,780
There's another instance where he was living at Walden pond.

329
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,360
There was an instance where there were a couple of young men who had a young girl with them

330
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,080
at the pond.

331
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,040
And he doesn't go into a lot of detail, but you're under the impression that these boys

332
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,080
were trying to take advantage of this young lady.

333
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,200
And thorough really went off on these guys and basically yelled at him and made them

334
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,440
go away.

335
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,040
So he was defending this young lady's honor.

336
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,160
Oh, very noble.

337
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
What a chivalrous guy he was.

338
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,680
But yeah, there's all these weird little things like this, all these weird little stories

339
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,240
happening when he's at Walden pond.

340
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,600
These women steal the dipper.

341
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,280
Doesn't he say, he says something really nasty about him afterwards, if I'm not mistaken.

342
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Yeah, he did.

343
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
I lost the mark.

344
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,160
But basically he says something along the lines of, I mean, what he's saying is basically,

345
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,840
they should have known better and they'll rue the day or something.

346
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,160
I'll find my revenge.

347
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Right, yeah.

348
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,080
Or they're going to end up feeling guilty about it and I hope they realize what a bad

349
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
thing they've done.

350
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,240
So yeah, so again, Henry being kind of judgmental, but they stole his dipper.

351
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,960
And remind us how old he is at this time.

352
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,520
When he moved to Walden, he was about to turn 28 and he left when he was 30.

353
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,680
It's a little young to be in the get off my lawn stage of life.

354
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,840
A little young to be in that stage of life, but he's also, here's the guy who's leading

355
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,760
this life that he thinks he's on a higher level.

356
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,880
And I'm not saying that to be snarky because he really felt like he was kind of trying

357
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,600
to better his life.

358
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,840
And when he sees people around him not doing that, it's when he got really disappointed

359
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
in mankind.

360
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,200
It really bothered him when he didn't see people living up to their potential.

361
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,240
Be they drunkards or girls stealing dippers or whatever.

362
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,040
What do you have next for me?

363
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Let's see.

364
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,520
Oh yeah.

365
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,920
So his best friend was a poet named Ellery Channing.

366
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
And they were thick as thieves.

367
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,080
They went on walks together all the time.

368
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,640
They traveled together.

369
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
So this is from 1852.

370
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,880
Channing says he keeps a dog for society to stir up the air of the room when it becomes

371
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,720
dead for he experiences awful solitude.

372
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,480
Another time thinks we must cultivate the social qualities.

373
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,320
Perhaps I'd better keep two dogs a piece.

374
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,800
They did have a dog.

375
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,640
Channing had a dog.

376
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,420
They called it Professor because he was kind of stupid.

377
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,320
Other people in town called it Professor because they thought the dog was probably smarter

378
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,280
than Ellery or Henry.

379
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,840
But they said that they liked having the dog with them because they would walk out.

380
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,280
And it was a newfoundling.

381
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,720
So it was a fairly big dog.

382
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,760
But he would stir up quail and rabbits and stuff that they wouldn't have seen otherwise.

383
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,320
So that's why Thurow liked having the dog.

384
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,760
Although it should be said here and now that Thurow was not necessarily a dog person.

385
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,680
He was a cat person.

386
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,520
He wrote about cats.

387
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,440
And the Thurow family had lots of cats over the years.

388
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,200
He wrote about these cats all of the time.

389
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,520
That's classic cat person.

390
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,640
He is a classic cat person.

391
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Sure.

392
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,200
He'd be posting the pictures of his cats on Facebook.

393
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Absolutely.

394
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,800
He'd be the cat person on Facebook.

395
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,880
And he'd be sharing the cute cat videos on YouTube.

396
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Oh yeah.

397
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:18,320
There's this one instance where the cat, I think it was the cat Min, there was a mouse.

398
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,240
And the cat was playing with a mouse.

399
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,520
And then the Thurow's rooster came along and grabbed the mouse and threw it up into the

400
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,560
air and swallowed it.

401
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,040
And he said that the cat looked around for a while wondering where did that mouse go.

402
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,480
He seemed really confused by the whole thing.

403
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,600
He probably talked about this for days.

404
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Oh yeah.

405
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm sure he did.

406
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Yeah.

407
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm sure he did.

408
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
So yeah.

409
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
So Thurow was a cat person.

410
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,760
Cats would be all over his Facebook page.

411
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Love it.

412
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
I mean I don't love it.

413
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm not a cat person.

414
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,000
The more and more I'm hearing I'm thinking maybe Thurow wouldn't be my kind of guy to

415
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
hang out with.

416
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm not sure if he would be my kind of guy to hang out with.

417
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,080
To tell you the truth.

418
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
I would like to watch him.

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,720
I would like to see him speak and maybe see him interact with other people.

420
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,600
But I'd also be afraid of just being a total idiot in front of him and saying something

421
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,160
that either he didn't agree with or.

422
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,760
I've known that in this life as well.

423
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Just me being stupid.

424
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,600
You know I'd probably make some stupid joke and that would be the end of that relationship.

425
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Never meet your heroes.

426
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,560
That's why you make your heroes dead people.

427
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Absolutely.

428
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,000
I've been telling my heroes have been dead for 150 years.

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,080
So we previewed this in the beginning but I have gotten to the bathing section.

430
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Oh good.

431
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
OK.

432
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
And I.

433
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,840
So some of these I'm going to read in my own words or just telling my own words and some

434
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
of them I'll read.

435
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
This one I got to read.

436
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
OK.

437
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
Because I think it's fantastic.

438
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
And it's July 8th 1852.

439
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,640
This is not long after the Dipper incident.

440
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,720
He says he talks about this like we talk about intermittent fasting or taking certain new

441
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
thing vitamins.

442
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Right.

443
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm inclined to think bathing almost one of the necessities of life but it is surprising

444
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,200
how indifferent some are to it.

445
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,720
What a coarse foul busy life we lead compared even with the South Sea Islanders in some

446
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,320
respects.

447
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,720
Truant boys steal away debate but the farmers who most need it rarely dip their bodies into

448
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,040
the streams or ponds and was telling me last night they had thought of bathing when he

449
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,600
had done his hoeing of taking some soap and going on the wall and giving himself himself

450
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
a good scrubbing.

451
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,400
But something had occurred to prevent it and now he'll go unwashed to the harvesting I

452
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,560
even until the next hoeing is over.

453
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,320
Pray what were rivers made for one farmer who came to bathe and walled in one Sunday

454
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,840
while I live there told me it was the first bath he had had for 15 years.

455
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,520
What kind of religion could his be or was it any better than a Hindu's.

456
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Explain Richard.

457
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
OK.

458
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:10,880
So it's the mid 19th century bathing is not a daily occurrence for a lot of people or

459
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,240
annual in some cases.

460
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,720
Well because there's no running water at least not in Concord or in most places.

461
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,080
And so taking a bath was a pain in the rear end.

462
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,320
You'd have a tub of some sort.

463
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,540
You might keep it in the barn.

464
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,600
You might keep it in a spare room.

465
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
You'd have to pull the tub out.

466
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,680
You have to go out to the well get bucket after bucket of water heat up that water on

467
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,840
the stove put that water into the tub take your bath take that water out of the tub out

468
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,200
somewhere and dump it out.

469
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,280
If you've got a family of three four five six seven people that's a pain.

470
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,760
So bathing is not quite as common whole body bathing.

471
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,560
People would wash their face and hands on a daily occurrence.

472
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,840
That's pretty normal.

473
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,880
But the whole idea of bathing entirely it just didn't really occur to people because

474
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,120
it was just it was just a pain to do it.

475
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
And why.

476
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:18,360
You know there's also a popular concept at the time that a person's natural odors and

477
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,540
oils and everything that keeps you healthy.

478
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,080
If you're washing that stuff off then you're going to you're probably going to be susceptible

479
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,320
to disease of some sort.

480
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,720
Thoreau is not buying any of that when he's living at Walden Pond.

481
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,640
He was bathing almost every day.

482
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,160
Although he does write that he usually had his last bath about the middle of October

483
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,760
because the pond is frozen frozen.

484
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Yeah.

485
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,940
So the all cuts were a little bit different.

486
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,540
They were actually into cold water bathing when they were living over at the hillside

487
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,600
on Lexington Road.

488
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,920
Bronson actually set up a cold water shower for the family.

489
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,520
They believed in bathing almost every day.

490
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,560
But that's definitely the exception rather than the rule in mid 19th century Concord.

491
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,960
And you know here's this farmer who had net a bath in 15 years.

492
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah.

493
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,920
And he was I'm not sure if he was proud of it.

494
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,080
He was just like well yeah.

495
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Why would I.

496
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Right.

497
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm holding out because I'm being some martyr for.

498
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Right.

499
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,360
Being fully natural.

500
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,240
It is why would I.

501
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,520
I also think that you know if you went back to the 19th century you're walking down Main

502
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,720
Street in Concord in 1852 there would have been a lot of smells.

503
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,160
Yeah.

504
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,560
I think all of these people would have smelled like wood smoke.

505
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,560
I think they would have all smelled a little bit like sweat.

506
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:46,360
I think they would have all smelled a little bit like if you're a farmer something not

507
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
so pleasant.

508
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Yeah.

509
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,440
You know especially if you're shoveling muck and manure all day.

510
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,540
It's not.

511
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,400
It's not like they all walked around going oh look at me I stink.

512
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,200
I think it was just that was what it smelled like.

513
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Just the way it was.

514
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Right.

515
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
And you get used to it.

516
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Probably just smelled like nothing.

517
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Right.

518
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,240
It's like when you're cooking something in your kitchen and you're not really smelling

519
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,360
it because it's slowly coming onto you then you leave the room or you leave the house

520
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,640
for a minute you come back in and it just smells amazing.

521
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Right.

522
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Exactly.

523
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
That's the sensation that comes to you.

524
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Yeah.

525
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,120
And there were people who you know there were perfumes and colognes and stuff like that.

526
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,240
At the time a lot of men were using hair oil which supposedly smelled pretty good.

527
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,480
So I think they were aware of it and there was a certain amount of cleanliness at least

528
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,800
some people were bathing once a week.

529
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,040
But they weren't washing their face and hands every day.

530
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,240
There was shaving going on and stuff like that.

531
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,400
We can be assured that if I get in a time machine and go back to this time and conquer

532
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,480
it and go into a tavern I will pass out.

533
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
You probably will.

534
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,440
Well and also you think about that you go into the tavern there's cigar smoke there's

535
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
pipe smoke.

536
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
That helps.

537
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
A little bit.

538
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Yeah.

539
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Yeah.

540
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,680
So yeah I think of that not wanting to meet your heroes.

541
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,720
Yeah.

542
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
You know I just imagine.

543
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,800
Well you know they talk about the Civil War how these guys just all smelled horrible.

544
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah.

545
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,760
Whole armies would march by and they said it was the smell would linger for days and

546
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
days.

547
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Right.

548
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,520
So the 19th century was not a place for the faint of faint of smell.

549
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Not my place.

550
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
No.

551
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,360
What do you got for me next.

552
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,360
Let's see what do we have.

553
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:45,440
Oh yeah.

554
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,720
This is a good one.

555
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
June 17th 1853.

556
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:59,720
Here have been three ultra reformers lecturers on slavery temperance the church etc. in our

557
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,440
house the last three or four days.

558
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,360
And then he talks about who these ministers are.

559
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,920
Excuse me.

560
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,640
They addressed each other constantly by their Christian names and rubbed you continually

561
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,440
with the greasy cheeks of their kindness.

562
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,900
They would not keep their distance but cuddle up in life spoon fashion with you no matter

563
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:31,400
how hot the weather or how narrow the bed.

564
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,680
He was talking about one of them in particular.

565
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,760
They lick you as a cow licks her calf.

566
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,380
They would feign rap you about with their bowels.

567
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,400
And one of them addressed me as Henry within one minute from the first I first from the

568
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,080
time I first laid eyes on him.

569
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,040
And when I spoke he said withdrawing sultry sympathy.

570
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,240
Henry I know all you would say I understand you perfectly.

571
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,880
You need not explain anything to me and to another.

572
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,200
I am going to dive into Henry's in most depths.

573
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,680
And I said I trust you will not strike your head against the bottom.

574
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:22,360
So they lay their sweaty hand on your shoulder or your knee and try to magnetize you.

575
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,120
So he's not impressed with these reformers these ministers that were staying at his mother's

576
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,320
boarding house for a few days.

577
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:39,440
He didn't he didn't take reformers he didn't take to so-called reformers very kindly if

578
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:47,600
it seemed like they were doing it either for the money or for the fame or for the notoriety.

579
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Yeah.

580
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,500
And this is a really long journal entry.

581
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,280
One of them wrote a book and he said that you know he shocks all the old ladies with

582
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,040
his infidelities in this book.

583
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:05,520
So he thinks that these are guys these are like the televangelists of their day.

584
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Sure.

585
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,120
And you know the type.

586
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,920
And when I read this journal entry those are the types I imagine.

587
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Right.

588
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,320
Or the televangelists you see.

589
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Yeah.

590
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,600
And they just seem so smarmy and so fake and so so slick.

591
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,640
He sees right through them.

592
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,360
And that's what these guys were.

593
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,800
And so he's completely turned off by him.

594
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,000
You know he was friends with people like William Lloyd Garrison and the Alkitts and Wendell

595
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,520
Phillips and other diehard abolitionists.

596
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,320
And he really believed in what they were doing.

597
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,000
But it's these kind of guys who are just like a dime a dozen that completely completely

598
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,280
threw him for a loop and he couldn't stand being anywhere near him.

599
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Yeah.

600
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,240
Well it's funny you mentioned Garrison Phillips because I have some trash talk about them

601
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,800
as well as Harvard all in one sentence.

602
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,700
Oh great.

603
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
It's the trifecta.

604
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Yeah.

605
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,880
This is Alcott and the Abolition Society.

606
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,560
So Alcott this is August 10th 1853.

607
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:10,000
Alcott had spent the day before at Emerson and came to visit him.

608
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,080
And basically it sounds like Alcott the it says the question of livelihood was troubling

609
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
him.

610
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
So what was he going to do to get paid.

611
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,280
What was he going to do to make a living.

612
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,040
And he offered his services to the Abolition Society to go out in the country to speak

613
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,240
for freedom but they declined him.

614
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,080
And he says this is very much to their discredit.

615
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,960
They should have been forward to secure him.

616
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,400
Such a connection with him would confer unexpected dignity on their enterprise but they cannot

617
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,880
tolerate a man who stands by a head above them.

618
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:50,360
So he obviously holds Alcott in higher regard than even these other people.

619
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,800
And this is this is the punch line.

620
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,600
Gareth is bad Garrison and Phillips etc. as the overseers and faculty of Harvard College.

621
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,840
They require a man who will train well under them.

622
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,080
Consequently they have not in their employ any but small men these trainers.

623
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:16,040
See that's he's slamming everything that was considered something you shouldn't slam.

624
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,920
You know you don't you know you don't say nasty things about Harvard especially if you're

625
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,160
a Harvard graduate.

626
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,280
You know you know you've got these men these great men.

627
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,160
And he did like Phillips and Garrison but he obviously liked Alcott a lot more.

628
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:43,120
So thorough is one thorough and Emerson were two of the few people that stood by Bronson

629
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,160
Alcott no matter what.

630
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,080
You know he had a reputation and still has this horrible reputation for being lazy and

631
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,560
he's letting the little women starve and he's impractical and he's a much better talker

632
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,520
than he is a doer etc etc.

633
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:09,320
But in his day in their day Bronson really had a reputation for being a man who stood

634
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,400
by his convictions and was a diehard reformer and abolitionist.

635
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,320
And thorough and Emerson absolutely believed in him as a genius.

636
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,920
Emerson at one time called him a half god you know and couldn't believe that people

637
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,800
weren't taking him seriously.

638
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,040
But because he was a little impractical and he was a terrible writer and he seemed a little

639
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,360
bit like kind of like an absent minded crank at times.

640
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,720
People didn't really take him that seriously.

641
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,200
And so I think that what happened was Garrison and Phillips and the other abolitionists they

642
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,600
probably were afraid that Alcott's reputation would precede him.

643
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,880
So they're very serious and they're very intense and here's this guy who's kind of considered

644
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
kind of dreamy and kind of weird.

645
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,920
And they didn't want to they didn't want to be associated with that.

646
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,400
As much as they liked him.

647
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
They thought it would ruin the brand.

648
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Absolutely.

649
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:23,120
But from what we understand everybody even his detractors really liked the man.

650
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,180
They thought he was kind and gentle and intense and serious and he believed 100 percent in

651
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,360
whatever it is he wanted to believe in his transcendentalism.

652
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,840
But on the other hand they don't really want to hang out with him and they don't really

653
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,340
want him to be part of the brand as you would say.

654
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,000
Which is interesting because there was an instance in 1854 when there was a runaway

655
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,600
slave in Boston Anthony Burns who was arrested and he was going to be sent back to slavery.

656
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,880
And there was this big riot in Boston at the old courthouse to try to save him.

657
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:07,320
And there were some gunshots and the crowd refused to go near the courthouse and only

658
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,080
one guy walked forward to try to save him and it was Bronson Alcott.

659
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,720
He walked across the plaza up the steps of the courthouse and he turned to the crowd

660
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,040
and he said why aren't we inside.

661
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,560
You know and to me that's like Bronson Alcott's greatest moment.

662
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,880
Because he's the only one even though he might have gotten shot who knows what could have

663
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,100
happened but he bravely and calmly walked across the courtyard up the steps of the courthouse

664
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,880
to say why aren't we going inside.

665
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,160
And to me this huge crowd of people are cowards and here's this guy this lone guy walking

666
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,660
across the courtyard.

667
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,520
So he was absolutely dedicated and so and Thoreau knew that.

668
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,360
Thoreau was like they're kind of missing out on having him with them.

669
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,160
He would have added a lot he thought.

670
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:06,840
Well I think I mean even in even today I've been part of many organizations boards committees

671
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,840
all these different all these different entities that perform actions.

672
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,400
And I would say that it still remains true that there are many different types of thinking

673
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,780
in this world and that people who are very lenient tend to be more linear very organized

674
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:31,000
people who have a message they're sticking to it that someone who's more maybe more this

675
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,560
more dreamy creative scattering person while interesting and full of ideas maybe is someone

676
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,280
they don't quite understand or they're almost like dangerous to them because they don't

677
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,880
know where they're going to go.

678
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,400
And they might say our organization is about this very specific thing this is exactly what

679
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,840
we're going for and this person might take us off might take us off of that mission.

680
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,960
Right and the transcendentalist whether it was Emerson or Thoreau or Bronson Alcott they

681
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,920
all kind of had I'm not going to say it was their reputation but it's what a lot of more

682
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,560
mainstream people thought of them.

683
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,880
Yeah you know they thought Thoreau was this weird hermit living in the woods by himself

684
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,880
who who was just kind of communing with nature.

685
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,520
Yeah they thought Bronson Alcott was this dreamy idealist and they all had this reputation

686
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,080
which kind of lasted even up until today.

687
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,440
I still talk to lots of people who they think all Thoreau did was live at Walden Pond and

688
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,080
grow beans and he didn't really do anything.

689
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,880
You know except sit around and be judgmental.

690
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,720
Yeah a bit of that.

691
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,920
Absolutely you know it's it's kind of it's kind of interesting that yeah Thoreau was

692
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:51,280
incredibly judgmental if you read him that way but I also think that he was he was just

693
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,640
he's just trying to help you man.

694
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,560
He's just trying to trying to get you through your daily grind.

695
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah yeah you know and he's trying to give you advice and he even says in Walden he says

696
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,280
I would have no man adopt my mode of living on any account.

697
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,680
So I've got a good one.

698
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Let's do it.

699
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,000
This this just this is just so weird.

700
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
July 25th 1853 I have for years had a great deal of trouble with my shoestrings because

701
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,960
they get untied continually.

702
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,840
They are leather rolled and tied in a hard knot but some days I could hardly go 20 rods

703
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,320
before I was obliged to stop and stoop to tie my shoes.

704
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,720
My companion and I speculated on the distance to which one tying would carry you the length

705
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,580
of a shoe tie and we thought it nearly as appreciable and certainly a more simple and

706
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:55,640
natural measure of distance than a league or mile.

707
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,240
Ever in a non we raised our feet on whatever fence or wall or rock or stump we chance to

708
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,680
be passing and drew the strings once more pulling as hard as we could.

709
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,840
It was very vexatious when passing through low scrubby bushes to become conscious that

710
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,240
the strings were already getting loose again before we had barely started.

711
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:23,240
What should we have done if we were pursued by a tribe of Indians.

712
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:32,000
So it goes on and on and on and on and at last the other day it occurred to me that

713
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,080
I would try an experiment and instead of tying two simple knots one over the other the same

714
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,920
way putting the end which fell to the right over each time that I would reverse the process

715
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,320
and put it under the other.

716
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,960
Gratly to my satisfaction the experiment was perfectly successful and from that time my

717
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,280
shoestrings have given me no trouble except sometimes in tying them at night.

718
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,680
On telling this to others I learned that I had been all the while tying what is called

719
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:12,560
a granny's knot but now I had blundered into a square knot.

720
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Should not all the children be taught this accomplishment and devoted to instruction

721
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,360
in tying knots.

722
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,240
So Henry's walking around for years with his laces coming undone and then this is 1853

723
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,840
he's 35 years old and he figures out how to tie a square knot.

724
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:42,320
Wow that's I just find that so absolutely hilarious and so bizarre.

725
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,360
I and the fact that he's so fascinated and writes in such detail about it he's really

726
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
proud of it.

727
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,280
Yeah he blundered onto a square knot so of course I do living history as thorough and

728
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,680
years and years ago and ever since I've been doing Henry I've always tied my shoes as thorough

729
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,480
into a square knot and years and years ago I was doing a gig at the Concord Museum and

730
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,080
this woman came up to me and she was always kind of a smart aleck and always trying to

731
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:18,520
get me to break character and she said so if you're Henry thorough show me your shoelaces

732
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,200
and so I showed her my shoelaces and of course they were tied into a square knot and I said

733
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,840
they're tied in a square knot of course and she was like damn it.

734
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,400
She's going to get you.

735
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,720
So yeah so if you ever see me as thorough you will see my shoes tied in a square knot.

736
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Does Richard Smith tie his shoes in a square knot?

737
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
I do not.

738
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,320
No I don't go that far because I agree with him because they're leather shoelaces and

739
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,800
at times when I'm done being Henry they're hard to untie.

740
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,880
I get it I feel Henry's pain when it comes to shoelaces.

741
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,560
All right well I have two more and one is two very short ones together but it's and

742
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,000
the first one is actually related to clothing as well but these are both just everyday observations

743
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,440
that he seemed to find really funny.

744
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,600
This first one reminds me of how in Shakespearean times when they would do plays that they would

745
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,120
find the weirdest things hilarious like if someone came out and mismatched socks it would

746
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,440
make the crowd go wild.

747
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,840
So he says February 19th 1857 an old man one of my neighbors is so demented that he put

748
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,240
both legs into one leg of his pantaloons the other morning exclamation point he doesn't

749
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,680
use many exclamation points so clearly he was he's amazed by this.

750
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,400
The next one everyday observation.

751
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,560
But is that it?

752
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
That's it.

753
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,120
But he's found it crazy enough that he was going to write it down.

754
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,520
March 11 1859.

755
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,720
E. Hosmer says that a man told him that he had seen my uncle Charles take a 12 foot ladder

756
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,600
set it up straight then run up and down the other side kicking it from behind him as it

757
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
went down.

758
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,120
E. H. told of seeing him often at the tavern toss his hat to the ceiling twirling it over

759
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,920
and catch it on his head every time.

760
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,160
So kind of stupid human tricks.

761
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,160
That's exactly what they are.

762
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,400
Yeah from back in the day.

763
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,880
Well see and it's those kind of stories that Thoreau loved to put into his journal because

764
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:26,600
these are the little weird bizarre things that that people are talking about in the

765
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
streets of Concord.

766
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Yeah.

767
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,320
Did you see did you see the guy with the ladder.

768
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Yeah.

769
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,600
It was the craziest thing he ran up and then kicked it down and went down to the other side.

770
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,840
Right and I'm sure the magician and I'm sure the guy putting his pants his legs in the

771
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,920
same pantaloons I'm sure that one are all around town.

772
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,920
Yeah.

773
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,520
Does he say does he say if he saw it or if he heard it.

774
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,520
He said he saw it.

775
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
OK.

776
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Yeah.

777
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,680
But I'm sure he told everybody well everyone you wouldn't believe what I saw.

778
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Exactly.

779
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
I have one last good one.

780
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Bring it.

781
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
OK.

782
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:03,800
So Uncle Charles Dunbar his mom's brother lived with them with the Thoreau family for

783
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,520
quite some time before he passed away.

784
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,200
January 1st 1853 after talking with Uncle Charles the other night about the worthies

785
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,620
of this country Daniel Webster and the rest as usual considering who were geniuses and

786
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,840
who were not.

787
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,120
I showed him up to bed and when I had got into bed myself I heard the chamber door open

788
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,960
after eleven o'clock and he called out in an earnest stentorian voice loud enough to

789
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,640
wake the whole house.

790
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,480
Larry was John Quincy Adams a genius.

791
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,120
No I think not was my reply.

792
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,560
Well I didn't think he was answered he.

793
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,840
And that was it.

794
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,760
So those are the kind of conversations he and he and Uncle Charles are having.

795
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,800
Well for bedtime.

796
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:04,840
The last one I had and this is I don't know my head at this out but I just I have to know

797
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,600
if 15 year old me is thinking along the right lines.

798
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,720
This is where we're going off PG and you might want to go earmuffs if you're listening to

799
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,400
this if you might be offended.

800
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,900
But this is something Henry wrote so I want to cover it.

801
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:25,240
So August 11th 1852 Alcott was here the ninth and tenth.

802
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,220
He had been to his native town of Walcott Connecticut and on this errand faithfully

803
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:36,740
peruse the records of some 15 towns read the epitaphs and as many churchyards and wherever

804
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,620
he found the name Alcock excerpted it and all connected with it for he was delighted

805
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,360
to discover that his original name was all cock and meant something that his grandfather

806
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,440
or great grandfather bore it.

807
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,580
Philip Alcock though his son wisely changed it to Alcott.

808
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,440
So he changed his name.

809
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,840
Did he change it for the reason that I think that I changed it for.

810
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,440
Yes so spelled A L C O C K.

811
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,040
Yes that was those are the ancestors of Bronson Alcott.

812
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:10,800
So his his name which probably was originally all cock all cock but was probably when it

813
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,640
was first formulated way back in the day.

814
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
Right.

815
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,560
Didn't mean anything salacious right.

816
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,560
A slang term comes out and his name all of a sudden becomes hilarious and they decide

817
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,560
they're going to change it.

818
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Is that how I'm reading that.

819
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,040
Is that what I think you're reading it exactly right.

820
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,120
Barrow says that they wisely changed it.

821
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:38,960
Yeah and and that's that pretty much coincides with the way that Bronson and Louisa's name

822
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,960
is pronounced.

823
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,800
So most people say Louisa May Alcott.

824
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,800
Yep.

825
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:53,240
But years ago when I was working at Orchard House the home of Louisa I was being trained

826
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,280
I had only been in Concord a short time I was being trained to be a tour guide there

827
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,840
and I gave this great tour to to Jan Turingquist who is still the director there and I was

828
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,880
saying Alcott Alcott Alcott and at the very end of the tour Jan said you did a great job

829
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,000
but it's all kit which would go with the change all cock.

830
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yeah.

831
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,560
So those of you if you're having a hard enough time getting used to saying Henry Thoreau's

832
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:31,000
name as Henry David Thoreau you now have to start pronouncing it Bronson and Louisa Alcott.

833
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's getting tough man.

834
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,880
I know it's a whole conquered thing.

835
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,600
You got to learn how to speak like these people.

836
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Concord thing.

837
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,280
Don't get me started on Peabody.

838
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
OK.

839
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,160
Well that that I that I had from Tennessee actually called the Peabody.

840
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
Oh.

841
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,320
I don't know instead of lot it was Lafayette Tennessee instead of Lafayette.

842
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,320
It's this way.

843
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,320
But anyway I think there's a Versailles in Indiana or Illinois.

844
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:01,720
But anyway so yes Thoreau as in I do a thorough job and Louisa May all kit like a CUT right.

845
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,720
Yeah.

846
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,720
L.L.C.T.

847
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Yes.

848
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Cool.

849
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,720
Well this has been a lot of fun.

850
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,720
I I did enjoy reading the book and I thought I learned a lot and I how lucky am I that

851
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,320
I get a chance to talk to you about it to add further context.

852
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,320
This is these stories I'm reading and this is my life.

853
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,320
This is what I do.

854
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:27,160
I read these things and I try to figure out what he's talking about and do research in

855
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,480
other areas too because a lot of times he's he's kind of he's not as detailed as he should

856
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,480
be.

857
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,480
Yeah.

858
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,640
And so you got to figure out what especially when he writes spent the day with E.H.

859
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah.

860
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,880
And you're like well who who the hell's that.

861
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Yeah.

862
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,160
And you got to figure out who E.H. was or whomever.

863
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,920
So you know Henry's journals are a great place to start.

864
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,760
I think if you want to get a really good sense of what Concord was like in the mid 19th century.

865
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Outstanding.

866
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:02,200
Well I'm glad we did this and I continue to learn more every week and get to know more

867
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,280
about my now hometown of Concord.

868
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
You're learning a lot.

869
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,480
You're getting the crash course.

870
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,960
Thank you Mr. Smith and hopefully we can do this again.

871
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
My pleasure.

872
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Thank you very much.
