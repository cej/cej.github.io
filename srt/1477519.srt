1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,280
Okay, this is Conquered Storytellers, episode three, with a very, very, very special guest.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,840
The 2022 Templeton Prize award winner, 2005 King Faisal Prize winner, 2004 Nobel Prize winner.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,720
This is kind of like when Tiger Woods tees off at a golf tournament and they list all the

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,960
all the tournaments he's won. Concord Resident, Neighbor, and full disclosure, my father-in-law.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,520
So if this goes poorly, then we can we could have him meet the parents part three premise, I guess.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Welcome. Thank you. Thanks for coming on. Yeah. Also happy birthday. It's coming up. I guess it's

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,800
your birthday week. We celebrated yesterday and I'd say I like really like shopping for presents

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,480
for you, right? Because these days I get to go to the toy section at Target with my son and pick out

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,800
fun stuff to play with. I'll say that it's interesting. We've known each other for a long

10
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,440
time now, but we don't we haven't really talked a lot about work stuff in either in either of our

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,440
lives. I think we kind of know if a day went well at work or not. But I'll say one of the highlights

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:40,800
from my business career was guest lecturing at your class, the Cross MIT and Arizona State class.

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,960
Because I thought it was a cool way to give insight into the things I've been doing for the

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,520
previous decade. And you got to I think see maybe a little more than you had seen in the past

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,880
of the work I had done. I've gotten a lot of peaks on it. Yeah. So I think I'm excited to talk to you

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,080
about the work you've done currently, but also in the past. And I think it's worth asking how many

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:17,520
how many jobs do you currently have? It depends how you count. But I, I would, I think I have four affiliations.

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,960
MIT, Arizona State University. I'm also a professor there and Stockholm University.

19
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,960
And then I have a relation some relationships in China. There's something called the T.D. Lee

20
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Institute of which I was director and now I'm chief scientist. And then there's something called

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,640
the Wilczek Quantum Center. Both are in Shanghai and there I'm also chief scientist and

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,400
sort of invested because my name is on it. Yeah. And that's is that fully built now and functioning?

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:07,360
It's growing. It's evolving, I would say. Yes. So it's neither one is a finished product, but they

24
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,760
they've come a long way and are starting to be significant institutions in the scientific

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:23,840
firmament. That's great. I wanted to I think that for the perspective of this project I've been doing,

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,360
I don't think we'll go super deep into theoretical physics, but I wanted this kind of

27
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,880
talk a bit about how your career got going and how it's evolved, how it evolved over time.

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,040
I think that for most people in the world, something like a Templeton Prize or a Nobel Prize is

29
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,200
kind of like not real. It's something like almost unattainable and something that doesn't happen to

30
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:59,360
people in their world. Just getting started, how did you get interested in science in the first place?

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,640
Well, I've always been interested in science. My earliest memories are of taking things apart

32
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:16,240
and putting them back together. And I had a little notebook where I tried to make big numbers

33
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:25,360
and I saved up money to buy a telescope. All this happened in early childhood. So it came naturally.

34
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Also, my parents very much encouraged it and my school very much encouraged it.

35
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:41,200
And the outside world very much encouraged it at the time. I was born in 1951, so formative years

36
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:49,760
were in New York City during the Cold War. And the whole country was kind of mobilized by

37
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:04,160
this feeling that we needed to have technology that was going to protect us. And there was still

38
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,400
cultural memory fresh from World War II when the atom bomb and scientists were kind of like

39
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:25,440
magicians, very powerful, very central to the country's flourishing. And we were necessary to

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,680
stand up to threats, perceived threats. It was the time of the space war, the time of the

41
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
threats. It was the time of the space race and Sputnik.

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:45,440
So it was an exciting time. And so it was growing up with being a scientist was a very aspirational

43
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,760
occupation, it sounds like, even certainly more so than today.

44
00:05:49,760 --> 00:06:02,960
I think so, yes. It was much more viewed as a crucial component of society flourishing.

45
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,040
And scientists, as I said, there was still the penumbra of the atom bomb and this kind of magic,

46
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:20,320
that enormous power that scientists had. It was like magicians, but for real.

47
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,400
Well, I remember, do you remember looking, you were looking in your parents basement and

48
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,280
you had this, it was almost like a Cuban Missile Crisis board game. Do you remember finding that?

49
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:38,640
Well, yeah. I had many toys that touched on these themes.

50
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
That's wild.

51
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:50,080
But yes, this and I had a set of model rockets of different sizes and shapes. So it was sort of

52
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,240
showed our arsenal, different things like that. And I really enjoyed those things too, I have to say.

53
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah. And when specifically, you were always into sort of general sciences and math,

54
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
when specifically did you decide that physics was your passion?

55
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:18,480
Oh, I didn't decide on physics till quite late. In fact, when I went to college at the University

56
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:30,800
of Chicago, my intention was to try to understand how minds work rigorously with mathematical

57
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,120
methods. So what would now be called computer science, but also mathematical logic and

58
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,760
philosophy was a mixture of all those things. That's what I thought I would do. But when I

59
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:56,240
learn more about it, I realized that it was premature, that there just wasn't enough

60
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,800
basis to do what I hoped to do. And so I majored in math just to keep my options open.

61
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,200
And then I went to Princeton as a graduate student. I was still pretty young when I went to

62
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:24,960
Princeton. I had raced through school. And I went to graduate school in Princeton as a math graduate

63
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:35,760
student. It was kind of under false pretenses. I was pretty sure I didn't want to do pure mathematics.

64
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:47,040
But it was kind of the path of least resistance because it was easy to fulfill the requirements.

65
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:56,240
And I was pretty good at it. So I did that. And I looked around when I got to Princeton. I was

66
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,280
really kind of in the wilderness. I didn't know what I wanted to do. As I learned more about pure

67
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,320
mathematics, I became more certain about what I didn't want to do, which was that. But I went to

68
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:19,360
the seminars about physics, about biology, about computers. Although there wasn't so much about

69
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:30,560
computers at that time. Then... Were you even using... I mean, there was no computer science,

70
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
you said, but I mean, people were using, just starting to use computers around that time.

71
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:45,440
Well, it was the IBM 360. So it was a gigantic room that had access to this machine,

72
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:55,360
you know, with tapes spinning around and flashing lights. But to actually use it, you had punch cards.

73
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,960
You would type in a side room, you would type in these punch cards and feed them into the computer.

74
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,760
And you wouldn't get immediate output. You'd have to wait 20 minutes and then you'd get error

75
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,160
messages saying, oh, this, your semicolons and... They wouldn't get useful error messages, actually,

76
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,800
but things wouldn't work. And then you dope it out and figure out that the semicolon was in the

77
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,600
wrong column or something like that. And then when finally you got things to work, the output was in

78
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
a completely different building. It was a different world.

79
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:38,880
So it was a different world. So that actually impacted some calculations I was trying to do

80
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:51,600
later. But yeah, it was a different world. Anyway, it just so happened... Well, by kind of shopping

81
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,440
around and seeing what was going on, I got the impression that very interesting things were

82
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,960
happening in physics at that time that used the kind of mathematics that I really liked.

83
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,040
When I was a senior at the University of Chicago, or my last year at the University of Chicago,

84
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,960
I had taken a course from a professor named Peter Freund about symmetry in physics or group theory

85
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,760
as applied to physics that I really, really, really super enjoyed. He was very charismatic,

86
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,840
very enthusiastic. And it was the mathematics that I really liked. I fell in love with the quantum

87
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,320
theory of angular momentum, which to this day is my favorite thing in physics. It's this amazing

88
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,560
mapping of mathematically ideal structures into the physical world where you can make based on

89
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:59,120
very compelling kind of ideal mathematical conceptions, do calculations that then you

90
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,840
compare with experiments that very concrete things about the directions that particles emerge from

91
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:15,360
the decays and things like that. And not vague, it's very specific in details. I really liked that.

92
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,000
But I didn't... And he also gave the impression that there were still open questions. There were

93
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,640
lots of loose ends. But still, I didn't make up my mind at that point. Just logistically,

94
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,120
it was not a trivial thing to change programs in graduate school.

95
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,960
Well, especially in graduate school because professors only have so many slots for people.

96
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,400
When you go to graduate school as a mathematician, you're expected to be a mathematician.

97
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,280
But I was very responsible and kind of naive at that time. I didn't realize that that was

98
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,440
the expectation. Well, you were really young too though. I was very young. Were you 18 or 19

99
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:17,360
when you got out there? Yeah, I just turned 18. Just turned 18 to start the PhD program.

100
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:29,440
Just turned 18 or 19, yeah. And so I still was shopping around for things to do. I was kind of

101
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,400
lost for the first couple of years really. But then I was very fortunate in several ways because

102
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,840
the math building at that time was physically attached to the physics building. So it was very

103
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:53,520
easy to wander over to the physics building from the math tower. And so I went to seminars and

104
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:02,880
colloquia and saw what was going on. And I got the impression, which was correct, that very exciting

105
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,040
things were going on in physics that used some of the mathematics that I really liked about symmetry

106
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:21,600
and some aspects of what's called analysis. And I met a very charismatic young professor named

107
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:33,920
David Gross who also happened to be the director of graduate studies. So he kind of greased the

108
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:44,080
wheels. Sure. I could make the transition and we hit it off right away. Was that a risk for him

109
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,720
to help you change? I mean, it's to sound like he had the power to make that happen.

110
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,000
A, he had the power to make it happen. I don't think it was a great risk for him. He was clearly

111
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,560
on the rise, kind of a star within the department. Although I think when I first met him, he still

112
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:16,080
didn't quite have tenure, but he got tenure just as at this point. And so it was him and then

113
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Ken Wilson, who was developing his ideas, which are very famous within physics and got him another

114
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,800
prize a little later about what's called the renormalization group. So new mathematical

115
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:40,720
techniques for analyzing how you can calculate the behavior of particles within the reticle

116
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,280
frameworks, how they behave at short distances and how you can compare that with the

117
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:54,080
experiment. But the ideas were pretty vague. They didn't work in a specific theory, but very

118
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:12,800
clearly fun. And so I just decided that that was what I could try to do. So the stars were aligned.

119
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:22,240
They were very interesting things going on. I had a contact and a very promising relationship to

120
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:31,600
build on. And so I went into physics. I had taken a few physics courses. I had read the Feynman

121
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:39,120
lectures as they were coming out. They're now famous Feynman lectures. And I thought I

122
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,680
understood them, but in retrospect, clearly I did not understand most of what was in there.

123
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,000
So I did make the transfer into physics. I learned just enough to pass the exams

124
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,760
that were necessary. They waived some requirements about experiments. And

125
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,960
within a few months, David and I had done the work that later got the Nobel Prize.

126
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:16,560
Well, I want to ask before you even started that specific project, was your feeling at the time

127
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,400
with physics almost like, I guess, maybe 10 years ago when AI started to emerge,

128
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,440
it's obviously an extremely hot topic now. You could tell it was you were at a fundamental

129
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:36,560
leaping point for theoretical physics. I think it's more like what AI was like maybe 20 years ago.

130
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,400
Oh, yes. We have to go back. It's very unclear. Yeah. Well, and then was there any sense? I mean,

131
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,320
I think with AI, there's always been this great sense of danger. Was there any of that sense with

132
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,560
any of this work at all? No, no, no, no. That would be very remote. I think it was very

133
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,520
and that would that would be very remote because this to this was work on

134
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,960
well, very fundamental interactions. But basically what happens inside atomic nuclei

135
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,320
and what happens at accelerators and things, so things where you have to

136
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:30,480
go to great trouble to investigate. Sure. So the practical applications seem very remote and

137
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,560
right. And in fact, have not they have there aren't any. Yeah. To make a little story short.

138
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,960
OK. And that's the least if there are they're very futuristic. So this is like I remember in

139
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,440
the movie Oppenheimer, they talk about lighting the sky on fire. And then, yes, I know in CERN

140
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,040
open people were saying, oh, my goodness, this is going to create a black hole that will consume

141
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,840
the universe. Right. That stuff is a little overblown in terms of those concerns. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,520
Well, that's right. Of course, the people who started nuclear physics had no idea that

143
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:20,080
it had the potential to make weapons. Right. It was a later development and later developments

144
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,840
did suggest that maybe playing around with very, very high energies could not ignite the atmosphere

145
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:38,880
in a fire, which was the issue with atomic bombs, but trigger a cosmic catastrophe where you change

146
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,400
the nature of the fundamental laws. Change the nature of space. That could be a problem.

147
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,920
It would be a big problem. But the good news is you'd never know what hit you. OK. Come out of

148
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,840
you at the speed of light. And yeah, but it's just over. It's just over. Yeah. You go over into a

149
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:14,880
purple haze. But those things, how should I say, they were very far from our minds and very far

150
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:22,880
from this was not an engineering endeavor. It was finding out what the laws are. And when you find

151
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,400
out what the laws are, they might have surprising implications. In this case, we found that

152
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,360
there was no, no hint of no real hint of possible catastrophes. Fantastic. Yeah.

153
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,800
That's great news. Yeah. So when you when you and David were working on

154
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:53,040
asymptotic freedom, was that something I should say? The thing that's relevant is that although

155
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,240
these conditions are difficult, the conditions of where you are probing the new laws that fund

156
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,280
them at very high energies, short distances, they're very hard to study under controlled

157
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:16,240
conditions. But in the history of the universe, they've occurred somewhere lots of time. Yeah.

158
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,200
With high energy cosmic rays all over the universe and in the big bang. And so, so just a priori

159
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,640
on that basis, the idea that you could trigger a catastrophe seemed very, very remote. Sure.

160
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:42,080
When you were when you and David were working on asymptotic freedom, did you kind of have the sense

161
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:50,240
that this was going to be as foundational as it was and lead to the Nobel Prize and other

162
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,600
career milestones you've had? Yeah, after the fact. I mean, sure. So it started out as

163
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,400
we as a very, from my point of view, a very theoretical investigation. I wanted to get a

164
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:12,320
thesis project. And this was putting together those ideas that I mentioned about the renormalization

165
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,880
group with that is study, which enabled you to study the behavior of theories at very high energies

166
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:32,720
and short distances in a precise mathematical way. With new kinds of theories, so called gauge

167
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:44,080
theories, which opened up possibilities for fundamental interactions that were previously

168
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:58,320
undreamed of. So the the best established theories of physics were and are in some sense still

169
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,680
the paradigms of what's called quantum electrodynamics, which is electricity and

170
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:14,320
magnetism merged with quantum theory and the general theory of relativity, which is both

171
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,320
of theories that have somewhat similar mathematical structures with high symmetry. And what happened

172
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:38,480
in the late 60s and very early 70s, just before we did this work was that people constructed a

173
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:47,200
generalization of electrodynamics and they sort of combined some ideas from electrodynamics and

174
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:55,760
general relativity into something called non-abelian gauge theories. And these were already

175
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:05,520
leading to a successful theory of what's called the weak interaction. So it wasn't clear how

176
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,840
successful it was going to be, but it appeared very promising at that time. And

177
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:19,040
there's something called the Landau ghost problem, which was a sort of disease of

178
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,720
electrodynamics and also in another way of general relativity. If you really

179
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,920
push the theory to very high energies or short distances, it would break down. The equations

180
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,360
would just become infinity equals infinity, nonsense, nonsense. And so

181
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:47,360
really inconsistency. You start the theory by assuming that there are concentrations of charges

182
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,400
at points in the, that's when electrons are concentrations of charges at points.

183
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,000
But then when you calculate the theory, you find that the charges

184
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:07,920
get canceled by effects of quantum fluctuations. So the theory kind of destroyed itself

185
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:22,240
conceptually. It worked, but only because you could sort of wall off this problem and not just,

186
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,160
if you refused to look, you swept it under the rug. But I wanted to see if you could do better in

187
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:36,960
these new kinds of theories, whether they would behave better. So that was the actual calculation

188
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:46,560
using these new techniques to describe new kinds of theories. And then the result was that the

189
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,880
theoretical problem did not appear in these theories. So that was a very, very profound

190
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,440
fact that made these theories seem really basic to our understanding of the world, potentially.

191
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,000
But I think that's the way that we can do it. And I think that's the way that we can do it.

192
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,840
That made these theories seem really basic to our understanding of the world potentially. And then

193
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,040
there were much more concrete issues with what's called the strong interaction, where there are

194
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,640
actual experiments that indicated that instead of the interaction getting more singular at short

195
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,440
distances, it kind of turned off at short distances when people took pictures of how things behave at

196
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:46,560
high energies. With a lot of image processing and theoretical insight, you can interpret these

197
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,600
experiments as saying that in fact, the interactions were getting weaker. So this was from a completely

198
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:04,960
different, much more empirical direction, an indication that you wanted a theory based on

199
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,160
these new classes of theories to describe the strong interaction. And David was very much coming

200
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,040
at it from that angle. He wanted to show to get a theory of the strong interaction. Well, actually,

201
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,000
what he wanted to do was show that it was not possible to get a theory of the strong interaction.

202
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Oh, interesting.

203
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:31,360
Yes. So he was anticipating a negative result, but we got the positive result. And that

204
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:42,960
was a breakthrough. And so it was possible to think that after all, you could make a theory based on

205
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,760
standard principles of relativity and quantum mechanics and these new kinds of highly symmetrical

206
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,600
theories that would describe the strong interaction.

207
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:07,520
And that's what we worked out. Enough about the implications of these ideas to make them

208
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,560
theoretically coherent and make a very specific theory and make specific predictions about how

209
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,760
the strong interaction should behave, but also how it should be interpreted. And so

210
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,520
strong interaction should behave if it actually is described by this theory,

211
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,480
which at that time, the experimental evidence was very shaky, but we could say exactly what

212
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:46,000
you needed to do to reach a decision. And so there was kind of circumstantial evidence,

213
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,760
and the theory was pretty, and there was no real alternative that was similarly compelling.

214
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,640
So I thought there was a fair chance, and we wrote it down, that if you take the experiments in

215
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,480
this theoretical framework at face value, this is the theory of the strong interaction. There's no

216
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:22,240
alternative, which was incredible because the prospect, even a few months before, of having a

217
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:30,480
specific, precise theory of the strong interaction after decades of frustration and resignation,

218
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,480
I think, on the part of the community was just unmindboggling. And the

219
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:47,440
... So when you released these results, when you released this, a paper was the product of

220
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
a scientific paper that was a product of this? Yeah, a series of three papers.

221
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,640
That had to be, maybe, was it nerve-racking to release that because you know so many people

222
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,400
would be paying attention to it? A little bit. Actually, very few people understood it at first.

223
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,200
I mean, it was very... The analysis of the experiments that led to this interpretation

224
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,720
was kind of involved and subtle, and the calculations were very of a new kind,

225
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,760
and they were very subtle. But a few people, they'd get it right away.

226
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:29,840
The other thing was that the experimental evidence was not completely clear. We made clear

227
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,280
predictions about what should happen at much higher energies, but given the available data at the time,

228
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:46,160
and it wasn't compelling at all. You could imagine you had to have a sort of sense of humor and a lot

229
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:54,720
of optimism to interpret it in the way we wanted to interpret it. But we wrote at the time that

230
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:04,240
this is... If you take things at face value, this is the theory. And I, right away, thought and took

231
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,200
it that, well, if you've achieved the theory of one of the main forces of nature...

232
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Yes, it's probably... Yeah.

233
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:26,320
... and sort of achieved what was at the top of the agenda of physics for decades, really, since

234
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,600
most of the 20th century, people wanted to understand what was holding atomic nuclei together,

235
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,480
and what were these things made... What was it made out of? And so I told David, I said to David

236
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:47,200
at the time, if it works out, if the experiments continue to point our way, that we'll get a Nobel

237
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Prize for this. And David said, now it's not the kind of work that gets a Nobel Prize. No, I realized.

238
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,720
You knew.

239
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,120
Right?

240
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,160
You knew. Yeah.

241
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Well, yeah, I knew. I mean, just it wasn't... I knew... Yeah, I mean, how often do you get to

242
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,040
explain and get the fundamental description of one of the basic forces of nature? Not very often.

243
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,520
That's every once every century or two?

244
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes. Well, there are four interactions. It's happened four times. Well, actually,

245
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,480
in the case of gravity, it actually happened twice because there was Newton's theory and then

246
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:33,280
Einstein's theory, which is a more refined theory, quite different. But yeah, so it doesn't happen

247
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,240
every day.

248
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:42,480
So when that dawns on you, does that become a weight on you for your career, that you're carrying

249
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,040
this big theory with you?

250
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,560
Well, certainly a platform, but also there's a lot of responsibility with that, right?

251
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,600
I didn't think of it that way. But it was a huge opportunity.

252
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,100
Yeah.

253
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:16,980
I didn't... So this breakthrough opened up many new directions. Because you could

254
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:26,260
understand how things behaved at very high energies and very extreme conditions, suddenly

255
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:35,780
you could, with confidence, make, or at least credibility, make models of the earliest moments

256
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:45,700
of the Big Bang. Before this breakthrough, it appeared that when things got very, very

257
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,380
close together in the Big Bang, very dense in the Big Bang, the strong interaction becomes

258
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:57,540
totally intractable. It was just a black... No one knew what to do. But when you learn that

259
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,340
the interactions kind of turn off and become weak, suddenly you can do it. And so that

260
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:10,420
opened up the very early universe and that led to important developments. It also meant

261
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:19,780
that you could analyze what was going to happen at high energy accelerators in much more

262
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:30,500
insightful and quantitative ways. So for instance, if you... Well, this only became clear years

263
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:37,700
later, but eventually people wanted to discover something, wanted to observe something called

264
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:44,020
the Higgs particle. But to figure out how you're going to produce this Higgs particle

265
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:50,100
and how are you going to... It's very unstable, so how are you going to detect that it ever

266
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:57,620
was produced? You needed a lot of control about how things behaved at high energies and how you

267
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:06,180
can relate the theory to experiments. So working out that kind of thing was a big deal.

268
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:15,380
And then the other thing is that, okay, so now we had a theory of the strong interaction,

269
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:21,780
weak interaction, electromagnetic and gravity, and they had kind of a similar mathematical

270
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,220
structure. Could they be unified into a bigger structure? So that was another thing. So all

271
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:34,100
these things, suddenly many new directions were opened up and that kept me busy for quite a while.

272
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,380
Yeah. I guess that's what I was thinking about when I said the weight of it was... I mean,

273
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,980
this creates a career for you, it creates a career for a lot of people, a lot of work to be done

274
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:52,340
that's still being done. And I guess I was wondering if it fell on you to organize that

275
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,900
or if the community just sort of self-governs and does that by themselves.

276
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,020
Well, I didn't think of it as a weight. I thought of it more as rocket fuel.

277
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:07,940
Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Yeah. Well, my glass was half empty there. No, that's great.

278
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,340
But yeah, I did feel some responsibility to live up to these opportunities, but mostly I just

279
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:23,780
thought of them as opportunities. The weight was, well, would it really be true?

280
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,020
Sure. Yeah. Well, you're pretty confident you have to validate, right?

281
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,740
I wasn't confident, actually. Oh, okay.

282
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,660
The data was... I mean, we

283
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,540
interpreted the data in a very bold way. The data was really kind of tentative, I would say.

284
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:52,660
Well, suggestive, but not definitive. And the really definitive data was almost 20 years later.

285
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:59,380
Yeah. So that was a weight. And then there was the weight of,

286
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,300
okay, when are we going to get a Nobel Prize? Right. So that ended up happening,

287
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,460
was it about 30 years later? Yes.

288
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,140
But it had been on your mind the entire time. I guess, from my perspective...

289
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,980
Well, yes. I mean, as I said, I thought eventually it would happen right away.

290
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,780
But I thought as soon as it became clear that the theory was correct, then it would be very quick

291
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:35,540
to get the prize. But that was unrealistic now, in retrospect, for two reasons. One is that

292
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,940
the downside of having a very precise theory is that the tests have to be made.

293
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,460
Yeah. Because the

294
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,740
Nobel Prize committees are very conservative. They don't want to give the prize for something

295
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,820
that's later proved to be incorrect. Sure.

296
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,700
So weight on the tests, that was one thing. And then the other thing was our work was based on

297
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:10,500
both experimental and theoretical work by others that was founded by the Nobel Prize committee.

298
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:26,900
And we were sort of... There was a kind of queue. So they had to get theirs first, logically.

299
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,500
That makes sense. Yeah. I just thought... I guess,

300
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:41,780
and then by 2004, I'm trying to think. For something that happened 30 years prior,

301
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:50,500
does that almost feel like that was a lifetime ago when the award comes? I mean, sort of...

302
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,940
Well, sort of. Yeah. It was a long time ago. It was quite a while ago, and a lot had happened

303
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,620
since then. Yeah. It makes me think of Paul

304
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,860
McCartney talks about his life as a beetle. And he says that just seems like someone else's

305
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,780
life almost, because that's a much bigger time gap for him.

306
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,500
Yeah. Well, it's also a much different experience. Yeah. Very different. Yeah.

307
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:20,420
Different rocket fuel. So although the Nobel Prize came later,

308
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,380
within the physics community, and I've gotten tenure at a great place and was

309
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:38,980
where I've gotten a lot of recognition within the community now. And myself, I felt I had,

310
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:51,940
maybe not perfectly, but I had really advanced. I had exploited a lot of the opportunities

311
00:39:51,940 --> 00:40:02,180
that were there, and I really done my bit. So it wasn't... And because the work kind of...

312
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:11,140
A lot of the work I did later grew out, grew naturally out of that development. I still

313
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:23,140
felt connected to it. And more than that, a vast community effort had gone into making,

314
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:32,420
exploiting these things, especially for analyzing what's going to happen at accelerators.

315
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:41,380
And so a lot of work in both theory and experiment. The calculations could be done

316
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:50,740
much more accurately than we did and carried much further. The whole way of doing experimental

317
00:40:50,740 --> 00:41:00,420
high energy physics changed because suddenly quarks and gluons were real things. And you could

318
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:12,100
sort of see them in what are called jets. So the focus turned towards analyzing properties of

319
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,780
jets. It was just a different world. So people knew what they were doing, in other words.

320
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,260
Sure, sure.

321
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:33,780
And had to readjust a lot of the technology to exploit this way of doing things. So from being

322
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:41,620
a kind of guerrilla warfare with a small band of people outside the mainstream,

323
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,260
which was what we were initially, it became absolutely armies of people pushing this forward.

324
00:41:51,460 --> 00:42:06,420
And so living through that whole process, there was a connection, even though the time was...

325
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:14,500
There was a lot of time. It's not as if it was a dream that passed and then you wake up

326
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,220
and it's a different world. Not like Rip Van Winkle where you're sitting.

327
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:33,060
Sure, sure. Yeah. Makes sense. So you get the call in 2004. What's that process like? What happens

328
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,100
when you go into Stockholm?

329
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:47,540
Well, okay. So starting with the call, as I said, from very early on, I thought it was likely that

330
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:57,780
we'd get a prize for this eventually, but there was a queue and I thought we might jump the queue,

331
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:09,620
but it didn't happen. But the people in front of us in the line, so to speak, had been served by

332
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:22,020
2000. So at that point I thought, okay, any year now it's going to happen. And so I knew when the

333
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:29,300
announcements would be each year, and it's a very specific time when they make the public announcement.

334
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,220
Actually, the way they phrase it is not before, but usually that means at the time. So unless

335
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:43,220
there's some kind of dispute or a last minute change of heart, they... No sooner means that's

336
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:54,500
when they announce it. Okay. So we knew that it would be announced at 12 noon Stockholm time,

337
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:05,460
which is 6 a.m. on the East Coast, which is where it was, in Cambridge, in fact.

338
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:17,140
And so I had a very difficult time sleeping because I knew I'm anticipating this possibility.

339
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:26,420
And on that night, which was, I guess, I don't know, we're talking about October 4th, 2004,

340
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:39,380
I wasn't able to sleep. And so about five o'clock after a restless night, I looked up at our

341
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:49,860
little bedside clock with the red LED lights and it said five o'clock. Okay. So I said,

342
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:57,220
all right, well, if the call comes at six, you're not sleeping, Frank. You might as well get up,

343
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:08,260
take a shower, and you'll be ready. Okay. So I got into the shower. And just as I was

344
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:17,860
beginning the shower, five minutes into it, Betsy came by, knocked on the door, and came in with our

345
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:26,420
mobile phone and said, I hadn't heard the phone call. She came in with the phone and said,

346
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:36,900
Frank, there's a call for you. Someone said, with an accent, says they're calling from Sweden

347
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,140
and they want to talk to you. I think you should take this call. And so I got out of the shower

348
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,660
and I took the call right away. I didn't draw you off or anything. It was something wet. And

349
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:58,740
yet that was it. It was not. So what I didn't know was that when they know what's going to happen,

350
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:07,700
they called earlier. And so that was it. And the other thing I didn't know was that

351
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:17,700
my anticipation was that the phone call would be, congratulations, you won the Nobel Prize.

352
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:24,340
Goodbye. But it wasn't that way at all. There were several people from Sweden, friends who wanted to

353
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,620
congratulate and other people who wanted to give instructions for how to deal with the press and so

354
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,740
and what you should not do and all of the details it was going to happen. So I was just

355
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:40,260
I was there soaking wet, dripping wet and listening to this for about 20 minutes.

356
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:47,220
So that was the initial experience. I thought I wouldn't go to process any of the instructions

357
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:55,700
that were being given to me on that call. But then I wanted to call my parents right away

358
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:02,500
because they're very important to them, I think. And I did right away. So I'll add to that.

359
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:11,060
That was probably five thirty. And my father answered the phone and he was really furious.

360
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:17,700
He said, what do you know what time it is? Whatever you're selling, I don't want any.

361
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:23,140
And if you call again, I'm going to report you. I said, no, no, no, it's your son.

362
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:31,060
And so that was a very special moment also. And then, OK, so then I was like,

363
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:38,980
then OK, so then I dried off and got dressed and six o'clock the announcement was made.

364
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,500
And right away there were phones was ringing off the hook and eventually we just took it off.

365
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:56,980
And and there was an AP stringer who knocked on our door and it was so it was it was a lot of fun.

366
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:04,820
Yeah, it was very and then there's a whirlwind of things. And then the press press conference and so

367
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:14,500
and you have to get clothes. Yeah. And it's a great party. So you get to talk and yeah.

368
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,700
Yeah. So it's a weak law. And another thing I didn't realize is that is what the nature of

369
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:29,700
the actual process is where you get the point is not just a kind of evening event.

370
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:38,260
It's a complete a whole week of one extraordinary event after another. You have dinner with the king.

371
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:48,260
You have the great dinner in the city hall with thousands of people and very elaborate service.

372
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:53,860
Singing and dancing. What was your favorite part?

373
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:05,220
I think my favorite part was after the dinner. This is the dinner of the king or no, the dinner

374
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:13,220
in city hall. See, OK, there's this there's music and dancing wait until the night. I like that.

375
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:20,260
I like that. It's a beautiful place and lots of happy people. Yeah. And everybody's I should have

376
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:29,620
said another aspect of it is everyone's dressed up and kind of 19th century academic costume

377
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:36,020
with a white tie, not black tie, white tie. And the women are in gorgeous gowns. And so.

378
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,860
So yeah, that sounds like out of a dream. It is. It's like a fairy tale.

379
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:47,460
Very much like. And so you get, you know, a medal and I think a custom painted

380
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,260
diploma. Diploma. Right. Yeah. And each one is different. Yeah.

381
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:59,780
I have a very silly question for you about that. So you receive this stuff at these ceremonies.

382
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:06,100
Do you just put that in your luggage and fly with it home or is it somehow like

383
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:11,700
specially couriered back to your home? Like that's obviously like a very historic.

384
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,140
Those are very historic things that you're receiving. Like how does that work?

385
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:20,180
It's a lot of good. Yeah, I just put it like that.

386
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:26,580
I was I was I was wondering that because we did the the Templeton Prize ceremony in 22.

387
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,460
And I remember you I think you flew to Sweden right after it. And I remember it was like you

388
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,340
get this beautiful diploma from them as well. And then I remember we left and it was just like

389
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,940
cardboard and masking tape around it to carry it back. And I thought how else would I was I

390
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,620
don't know if I was expecting it to be true. I brought it. I brought it back on Amtrak.

391
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,820
You brought it back. I brought it back on the Amtrak train and I put it in my car.

392
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,900
All right. Yeah. We framed it. Yeah.

393
00:50:54,260 --> 00:51:00,820
Yeah. Sure. I was like I was like why do they trust me? I didn't know if it was like the Stanley

394
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,660
Cup where they have the guys in white gloves like bringing around an armory cars or what.

395
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,020
OK. Thank you for answering my very very silly question. But I had as a middle

396
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:20,740
aged suburban dad I had to know. So I wanted to ask you also later in your career you've had

397
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,020
I think two names stand out to me. Axions and time crystals. Two of the cooler names.

398
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,980
Well also any and any on how do you how do you name things.

399
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,460
Well each one is a different story. So.

400
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:51,460
Axions were. It's probably the most interesting story. When I was still in college.

401
00:51:51,460 --> 00:52:03,460
I was home for the summer and went on a grocery shopping expedition with my mother and saw on

402
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:16,580
on the shelf a detergent laundry detergent named Axion. And I said to myself wow that

403
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:22,020
wow that really sounds like a particle. I was like you know there's protons and muons and pions

404
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:30,660
and this Axion. It's a nice weak root. And I said to myself if I ever get a chance to name a particle

405
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:38,500
call it Axion. And a few years later it was just a few years. Yeah. There's like four or five years

406
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:47,300
later there was a problem with an axial current and a new kind of particle that arises in

407
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:53,380
in that connection. I mean that's not the most important aspect of it but part of it was enough

408
00:52:53,380 --> 00:53:03,220
to do. There's enough of an excuse to actually call it Axion. That's cool. Yeah. So I did that.

409
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:10,420
And that would mean the crucial part was getting it past the editors of physical review letters

410
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:16,580
where we published it because if they had known that I was naming it after a laundry detergent

411
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,620
that would never be wild. Yeah. They're very conservative about these things. Yeah. So I was

412
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,100
very fortunate that I could drag in the axial current and say oh that's what that's what I was

413
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:39,060
named after. Named after the axial current. Yeah. So that was that one. Then

414
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:50,660
anyons was in a way the most straightforward. For many years people physicists had thought that

415
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:58,020
all particles could be divided into two kingdoms. Fermions and bosons they're called which have

416
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:04,660
quite different properties. Let me let me backtrack one second. One of the great achievements of

417
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:14,180
quantum theory is to show that very different concepts of what a particle is. So there's a wave

418
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:23,860
there's a wave aspect and a particle aspect that actually in quantum mechanics there's a more

419
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:30,420
general description that has both aspects. So it's neither a wave nor a particle but we sometimes

420
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:41,940
people call it a wave, waveical or that that is unites all entities all physical entities can be

421
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:47,540
described in this very general way. So things as different as electrons and photons which seem to

422
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:54,420
be so different in their properties can both be described using waveicals as people's.

423
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:03,220
But so that's a great unification but when you come to describe not single particles but

424
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:11,860
more than one like two or more then they're very different and there are two classes there are

425
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:19,140
bosons which basically like to do the same thing and there are fermions that dislike doing the same

426
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:27,940
thing. The dislike is the the liking to do the same thing is maybe most dramatically illustrated

427
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:33,380
in a laser where you see you have lots of photons that all want to be in the same color moving in

428
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:42,420
the same direction and the disliking doing the same thing for a fermion which electrons are an

429
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:49,460
example is what makes the periodic table work atoms build up with different states different

430
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:58,260
energy levels for the different electrons and many other phenomena. And for many years people

431
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:05,860
thought though those were the only two possibilities and I was not happy with the proofs that I had

432
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:16,660
read but it was in the back of my mind that there was there was not a holes in the argument and

433
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,340
by a kind of circuitous path I was led to

434
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:28,580
think that if you had particles not in three dimensions but in two dimensions

435
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,420
they wouldn't necessarily be particle either fermions or bosons that there are more general

436
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:40,420
possibilities and that's and then closer analysis shows that that that's the case.

437
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:50,580
So in the mathematical formulation when you have bosons there's a positive and a negative

438
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:57,220
bosons there's a plus sign in the wave function when there's fermions that's a minus sign

439
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:04,820
when you have any but when but there are other possibilities that involve complex numbers

440
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:14,580
that kind of interpolate between one and minus one technically it's phases or complex numbers

441
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:22,580
with magnitude unity any any of them. So since you can have any of these things in a continuous

442
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:33,780
range I call them anyons and that was accepted and they become a very very big topic since then.

443
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:40,100
At first I mean in the early days was kind of playful but it's become very

444
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:51,620
very serious as a possible technology for quantum information processing and quantum computers

445
00:57:52,260 --> 00:58:02,660
and just describing what happens in two dimensions. So that's anyons time crystals actually is

446
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:14,980
is something that my wife Betsy who you know is largely responsible for.

447
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,460
I was

448
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:32,580
thinking about how you might have states of matter or physical systems that behave

449
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:44,340
that naturally organize themselves into periodic structures in time. So crystals are

450
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:50,740
periodic structures in space but this would be things that spontaneously form periodic structures

451
00:58:50,740 --> 00:59:00,820
in time. And this was actually when we were walking when I was walking across England was

452
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:08,820
when I was thinking about this and Betsy was driving us a meeting into sort of the camp manager

453
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:14,660
and so but we had lots of time as we talked about it and she asked me to explain it and I

454
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:24,980
told her it's reaching for analogies and I said it's like a crystal but in time instead of space.

455
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:35,220
And she said it's like a crystal but in time instead of space. And I said I'm sorry I'm sorry

456
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:43,380
and I said it's like a crystal but in time instead of space. And she asked me what I was

457
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,900
what I called it and I said well I call it spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry.

458
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:59,860
Very remarkable. No no no no no no no no you you it's a time crystal and that

459
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:08,180
and she really insisted on it. I had misgivings about it I thought it was kind of too showy or too.

460
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:15,060
Well it made it into Avengers Endgame so. Yeah it made a but it was a great it turned out to be a

461
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:20,340
great thing to call it time because it really caught the imagination of the public but also

462
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:27,540
of scientists. A great name is really really important. Yeah I've learned. Does that does

463
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,180
that help you even with like does it move you up in experimental cues or anything

464
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:38,980
to have something that becomes that popular. Absolutely yeah yeah absolutely people it's it's

465
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,580
having a name for something

466
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:55,140
can really focus attention on so people experimenters can say what they're doing.

467
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:00,900
I'm making a time crystal. Yeah. Or I'm looking for any odds I'm looking for axions.

468
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:08,260
Whereas if you didn't have the name you'd have to go through a long long and dance about what it is.

469
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:14,500
And different people doing similar things wouldn't have a common language and yeah so

470
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,740
names are really really important. Yeah. And also

471
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:25,940
how should I say when you've named something you've real you've

472
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:33,860
taken your concept you have to refine the concept. Tell us you know define it. What what are you

473
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:43,620
talking about. And that is a very important discipline to be able to say damn it this is

474
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:52,820
what I'm talking about. This this word encapsulates this captures some years of thought. Yeah yeah.

475
01:01:52,820 --> 01:02:06,980
And and actually in all those cases when I named the thing I realized a lot but

476
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:13,220
it's grown into something later it grew each of these things has grown into something much larger

477
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:20,340
in many directions that I didn't anticipate. Yeah. But well did you firstly to have the name

478
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:27,620
because you know I got the paper still get keep getting quoted and it sort of attaches to me as

479
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:34,660
the founding father of this even though it's stuff now that is very very very very very very

480
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,220
even though it's stuff now that is very very

481
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,220
remotely related tenuously related to the initial conceptions. Yeah I mean like when

482
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:51,620
with any with any on did you envision quantum computing. Absolutely not no absolutely not no

483
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:58,020
it's just it but it's sort of like in the in the case of asymptotic freedom and quantum

484
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:10,420
chromodynamics I realized that it was a very very fundamental expansion of our understanding of the

485
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:23,300
physical world. So it would lead it could lead in really important directions was really foundational

486
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:29,380
you know so it wasn't just adding a brick here it was adding that it was changing the foundations

487
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:36,100
and so I although I didn't anticipate all these developments I'm not shocked that there have been

488
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:44,740
major developments coming out. Sure. That makes sense. I have I have two more questions for you

489
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,940
one is pretty quick and the other one I will let you dictate how much time you'd like to spend on

490
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:57,860
it. I want to say it's a really fun tradition for me it's been the last 10 years we go to an NBA

491
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:04,100
game every year. Yes. First one was in Miami and we saw LeBron and Chris Bosch Dwayne Wade.

492
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:10,820
This year we typically I know you're a big LeBron fan and we typically try to go see him

493
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:18,660
but this year at the scheduling workouts we saw Minnesota come. Yes. Who are you watching and

494
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,940
liking in the playoffs this year when we're in the conference final season. Yeah. Who are who's your

495
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:30,820
favorite. Well I think I'd better say Boston. That's that's Boston. Boston's an interesting

496
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:40,100
I like Boston because they kind of distributed there. They're a real team. I mean they have

497
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:50,820
stars but they're not dominated by a single star. Yeah. Tate and Brown and White and so and

498
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,500
even Al Horford plays you know all these guys play play roles and they're all important so that

499
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:10,580
that's nice. Of course I was rooting for the L.A. Lakers but they didn't come through and I also but

500
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:19,060
I like Denver. Yeah. Also for two reasons because I really think Yokech is so cool and so singular

501
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:24,100
his kind of approach to the game and just the effortlessness where he tosses in these

502
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,620
floaters. Yeah. He seems to be playing a different game and he's like a man among boys sometimes.

503
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:37,780
Yeah. He's so fundamentally skilled. Yes. It's really impressive to watch him. Yeah. And and

504
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:47,780
and you know that I've really been impressed by how after losing two games at home and looking

505
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:56,180
really bad they came back. So now it's it's not clear how it's going to end but they showed a lot

506
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:02,820
of character I think. Yeah. In coming back that way. So I and so also you know since they are the

507
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:10,580
team that beat the Lakers I'm kind of saying well you know if if they wouldn't go on to win the

508
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:15,460
championship that means that the Lakers lost to the champs. Yeah. They could be the second best.

509
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:19,380
They could be the second best. Yeah. I've always I've always felt that when my team loses in the

510
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:26,100
playoffs too. I'll say that I really enjoy it. We sat in the section that was kind of behind the

511
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:32,260
Minnesota bench. We went to that game this year and the joy that they had and like that team was

512
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:37,140
just a lot of fun. They're a team. And I they that's a team I never really thought about but

513
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:40,820
now I actually really like a lot just because of that experience. Yeah. So there are a lot of

514
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:47,300
teams to like in the in the you know all the you know all the teams really that are that are still

515
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:56,340
in the playoffs plus the plus other ones that they all have. I mean it's the whole well there

516
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:00,100
are some there are some teams that are very sour obviously you know these are things where

517
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:05,380
they had great expectations that weren't fulfilled and stars that kind of didn't come through or

518
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:12,500
injured or whatever. And that leaves a bad taste. But among but mostly it's a wonderful kind of

519
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:20,660
human enterprise to see people cooperating to try to do something remarkable. Yeah. They put an

520
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:26,660
enormous effort. They're incredibly skilled and gifted and you know like another species in many

521
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:39,220
ways. And and they're how should I say they've they've devoted themselves to to something bigger

522
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:48,340
than themselves. So you might say it's it's it's just a game and not serious and so but but you

523
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:55,460
know it's it's you could say similar things about astronomy or art or things that people think of as

524
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:06,020
as the ultimate human expression. People get very very good at something and put on a great show.

525
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,780
And it's wonderful to see. It's a good healthy way to take people who are naturally hyper

526
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:19,780
competitive and put that to use. Yeah. Yeah. That's a question. Is the world of theoretical

527
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:25,540
physics ever competitive. It's always always competitive. Yeah. You're always I mean to me

528
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:32,100
it sounds like always on top of what's going on always pushing things further faster and trying

529
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:38,900
to beat anyone else to the punch. Yeah. Yeah. And there's also a sort of defending territory. Sure.

530
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:51,860
Sure. But it's all how should I say it's it's much more sublimated than in sports where there's a

531
01:08:51,860 --> 01:09:05,140
score and it's and and mostly it's cooperative. But you know ultimately like the Nobel Prize it's

532
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:12,500
it's for any particular any particular year it's given to most three people for typically one

533
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:20,980
development. Yeah. And so but that's not the way science works. Typically it's not

534
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:30,420
how should I say the prizes are digital but sure the process is analog. Many people make

535
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:41,300
kind of contributions at different levels and so but yeah so there's but only one guy gets the job

536
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:48,260
and one guy gets the prize. Right. So so inevitably that makes for competitive situations.

537
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:57,780
And also there's a lot of the rewards in this kind of work are ego rewards.

538
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:03,140
It's people can live well on professor salaries and so

539
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:14,340
and but they don't. But some of the people in this world are really really super brilliant

540
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:21,460
and could make a lot more money elsewhere. Sure. The big rewards though are freedom you get

541
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:31,540
it and an ego reward you feel you're doing something permanent value and beautiful.

542
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:42,260
It really is kind of like an art in many ways. So that's but if you're going to have ego rewards

543
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:50,660
then egos get wrapped up in it. Yeah. I wasn't I never I hadn't thought about that. If you ever

544
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:57,220
had like a star student that you were disappointed to see get lured away to finance or something that

545
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:02,500
maybe you thought could have followed the the academia out and done very well.

546
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:12,980
Yeah well yes I but yes I have had students who've done that including a couple of the very best ones

547
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:31,460
yeah the most promising. But I think I it's like having a child that

548
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:41,380
ultimately you know you can you can teach and it's hopefully inspire and show them but ultimately

549
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:50,340
it's their life and they choose and I think if they're happy and

550
01:11:52,420 --> 01:12:00,420
and doing and not doing crime something destructive that's fine. I mean science

551
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:11,700
you know science is a big community and any individual I think is replaceable in some sense.

552
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:18,020
Okay some people might things might happen faster due to to some individual make an

553
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:26,500
outstanding contribution but even even giants like Newton and Einstein if you really analyze it

554
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,220
everything they discovered would have been discovered anyway. Sure. Maybe 10 years later.

555
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:38,740
Right. Well in Einstein's case maybe 10 years later at most in Newton's case

556
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:46,500
probably longer because it was a smaller community and must it was much less efficient but nowadays

557
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:53,620
with a gigantic community and very rapid communication and so forth I think

558
01:12:53,620 --> 01:13:03,860
the contribution of any individual is not essential. You know things will have so

559
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,860
so if my student if I have a student is very promising wants to do something else

560
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:15,380
God bless him or her. Right. If that their passion leads elsewhere

561
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:32,660
insecurity elsewhere. I don't feel let down. Yeah. Okay. I think okay last question this time I promise.

562
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,420
One of one of my perspectives I think about as I'm doing this project is

563
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:43,300
someone 50 years from now digging up this project and listening to it.

564
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,020
Where where do you think the conqueror and the rest of the world will be in 50 years.

565
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:56,260
Well I'm writing a book now called futures and sort of thinking about this and it could go in

566
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:03,220
very different directions and there are possible catastrophes I think climate change could be

567
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:12,340
catastrophic certainly nuclear war could be catastrophic but I'm very optimistic actually.

568
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,380
Good. I want to hear that. If

569
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:23,380
you think about what the world was like say 100 years ago

570
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:36,900
most people lived on farms and they were famines that many people and computers were just not even

571
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:42,740
on the horizon and look at speculations about what life would be like at that time. It's kind

572
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:51,780
of pathetic. Right. What actually happened even though in that 100 years we've had two world wars

573
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,180
many smaller

574
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,540
plagues

575
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:11,860
and the reason that things have improved despite all that is that we understand the world a lot

576
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:20,180
better and technology keeps getting better and better and during the 20th century and continuing

577
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:29,140
to the 21st century I think we've understood what matter is and what we're going to see in the

578
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:39,460
future what life is and now even what mind is at levels that were just not there previously

579
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,940
and that gives us enormous power

580
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:55,460
and having that power most people want to do good by other people not all but enough

581
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:02,100
yeah and producing you know producing more wealth

582
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:11,540
more opportunities for expanding mind for living longer living healthier

583
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:24,020
the kind of tools we have now for mind expansion I think all that is very exciting very promising

584
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:30,580
and so that's I'm optimistic there may be bumps in the road there may be very big bumps in the road

585
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:39,700
and there could be catastrophes but I'd like to think not and if not then I think
