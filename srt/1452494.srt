1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,580
All right, here we are. Season one, episode one of Concord Storytellers, and we are not

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,960
dipping our toes in the water. We're starting with one of the heavyweights from Concord, Massachusetts,

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:34,400
both in terms of guest and topic. We have renowned historian Richard Smith and Henry David Thoreau. Am I saying that correctly? Thoreau,

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,800
yes. Thoreau, not Thoreau. No, get it right. If you're coming to Concord, get it right.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,320
The Wikipedia article has four alternate pronunciations and instructs you on which one is correct.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,440
So I'm guessing you had a part in that. When I first moved to Concord in 99 to be a historian

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,440
here in town, I was a ranger at the National Park. I had started doing living history as

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,240
Thoreau. And this woman came up to me who had been here all of her life and she said,

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,360
if you're going to be this guy, you better learn to pronounce his name correctly. And

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm like, whoops. Which of course, I'm from Akron, Ohio. I had no idea. So we always said

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,560
Thoreau. So now when I say it that way, it actually sounds kind of strange. But yes,

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,160
we do know that it is Thoreau. His grandfather was a French Huguenot shipwrecked in 1773,

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,440
picked up by a British frigate, brought to Boston. In 1773, you do not want to have a

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:42,400
French name in a British city like Boston. So it was Jean Thoreau or Thoreau. And we

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,240
think that's about when he changed his name, at least the pronunciation, to John Thoreau.

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,960
He changed the spelling because nobody could read back then. But illiteracy was pretty

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,680
high. But John Thoreau was then Henry Thoreau's dad's name. And then his older brother was

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:09,520
John Thoreau. And Bronson Alcott said that Thoreau is well named because he is so Thoreau.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,880
And also Nathaniel Hawthorne, when he first met him, he spelled in his journal, Dined

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,080
with Mr. Thoreau, and he spelled it T-H-O-R-O-W. So that's a smoking gun.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
We know we are correct then.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,240
We know we are correct. So our job in Concord is to go out and spread the word that everybody

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,920
that comes to Concord, you can tell somebody is not from the area when they say Thoreau

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
and they say Concord.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,040
Right. Yeah. That's how I said it when I moved here. I grew up in Michigan and Tennessee

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,280
and I didn't know how to say anything. I was saying not only Concord but Worchester.

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Worchester, Glauchester.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah. I didn't know how to say anything. But now it flows. I can actually say things correctly.

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,880
Right. When I say Thoreau, it just comes out and I'll be talking to visitors or whomever

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,360
and I'll say Thoreau, Thoreau, and they'll stop me almost every time and say, I notice

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,480
you're saying this differently. So I go through the whole shtick that I just went through

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,640
with you. So if it sounded really well practiced.

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,400
Yeah. I can tell you've done that a few times.

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah. Just a couple. Yeah.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,120
So living historian. So I think you really, it sounds like you really help people kind

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,480
of immerse themselves in what life was like in Thoreau's time.

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Absolutely.

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,120
What was Concord like when he was born here?

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
He was.

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,080
What was it like? What was the town like? What were people doing? Take us back in time.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,920
So Thoreau was born over on the Virginia Road at his grandmother's farmhouse on July 12,

42
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,160
1917, about the time that he was born. And then when he died in 1862, Concord was always

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,080
around 2000 people, primarily a small farming town, just like every other small farming

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
town around here. You had Boston, which was the big city. You had Worcester, which was

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,400
a fairly good size city. And then in between, you had all of these small towns, Concord,

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,880
Sudbury, Wayland, Acton, Bedford, Hudson. They were all basically small farming towns.

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,160
Concord was no different than any of the other towns.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,920
But it had, you know, around that time, all these prominent figures and authors that you

49
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,240
mentioned, Alcott, Emerson.

50
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
That was coming.

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,440
So that was coming. So he was born there, but that wasn't established yet.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
No.

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
So when did that happen?

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,000
So that happened in the 1840s. I was going to say the main claim to fame to Concord in

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,840
1817 was the fact that the American Revolution started here.

56
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,920
And in Lexington, of course. But because of the Battle of Concord on April 19th, 1775,

57
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,360
that's the one thing, at least in those early 19th century, that kind of set Concord apart

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,260
from all of these other towns.

59
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,920
So the battlefield was here. Every year they would have what became eventually Patriots

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,260
Day and they would bring out the old veterans and they would have parades and basically

61
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,200
doing what we do now on Patriots Day here in town.

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,720
So that was our main claim to fame. By the 1830s, 1835, 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson was

63
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,800
living here.

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,160
So Thurow and Emerson are in the same town at the same time. 1840, the Alcotts moved

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,800
here. 1842, Nathaniel Hawthorne moves here.

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,280
So that's really when it starts to become this literary hub as opposed to just being

67
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,400
the place where the American Revolution started.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,280
Got it. So it was a small draw because it was kind of cool that you had all these activities

69
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,440
and festivities happening every year. But then a couple of these famous authors started

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,760
to plant roots here and then it just kind of became a draw and escalated from there.

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Right. And that's all because of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

72
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Okay.

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,480
So Emerson's related to some of the first founders of the town, the Balkleys. And his

74
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,600
grandfather was over at the Old Manse and he was part of the Battle of Concord. And

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,960
although Emerson was born in Boston, he considered Concord his ancestral home. And so he moved

76
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,960
here in 1834, lived for a year at the Old Manse where he wrote his first book, Nature,

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,520
bought his house over on the Cambridge Turnpike in 1835. And he was here for the rest of his

78
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:24,160
life till he died in 1882. He wanted to create a literary scene. So the Alcotts are here

79
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,280
because of him. Hawthorne kind of sort of ended up here because of him. But all these

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,840
other writers and poets and philosophers and assorted oddballs, they're all coming to Concord

81
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,000
because of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The fact that he and Thoreau are here at the same time is

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,320
just really great historical coincidence.

83
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,700
Okay. Got it. And for Thoreau, I mean, looking in his background, his father was a pencil

84
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
maker.

85
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
He was.

86
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,940
For a living. What was life like growing up here for him?

87
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:01,160
For Henry, they were pretty poor, actually. So he's born in 1817. His dad had had several

88
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,800
jobs. He was a grocer for a while. The first eight months of his life was over on Virginia

89
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Road. They then moved into another place in Concord. They then lived in Chelmsford for

90
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,120
a while where his dad was a grocery store clerk. Eventually moved to Boston and then

91
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,120
back to Concord. But his dad had a hard time really kind of making a go of various occupations.

92
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,520
Thoreau's uncle Charles had discovered a graphite mine up in New Hampshire and started

93
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:40,800
this making pencils. And so in 1824, 25, somewhere around there, he asked John Thoreau if he

94
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
would be part of this pencil making company, which he did. And then Uncle Charles dropped

95
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,840
out. So by the late 1820s, it was John Thoreau pencils. Eventually became John Thoreau and

96
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
sons.

97
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,920
Got it. And so Henry David, it was David Henry originally, right?

98
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
He was.

99
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,920
So he's growing up, sort of sounds like sort of his early teenage years. This is starting

100
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,160
to happen. How does he become, you know, he eventually goes to Harvard to study. Like

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,360
what, how does he kind of get into this literary and sort of quasi political mindset?

102
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,440
Sure. Well, that comes from his mom, his mom. We know a great deal about both of his parents,

103
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,720
but his mom was very much involved in social reforms of the day and his sister. So there

104
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,880
were four Thoreau kids. There was Helen born in 1812, John Jr. 1815, Henry 1817, Sophia

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,840
1819. All of the kids from what we understand were absolutely brilliant. And because of their

106
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:52,240
mom very much involved in reforms of the day, especially antislavery. So he came from a reform

107
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,720
minded house where mom was involved in not only the antislavery society, but the charitable

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,080
society where they would help poor people. So he kind of grew up in that kind of atmosphere

109
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:12,680
of being socially aware and being socially involved. Right on. And how does he end up

110
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,160
studying at Harvard and what happens when he goes there? So Harvard in 1833 when he

111
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,760
went, he was 16 when he went to college. He's a little bit older than most Harvard boys

112
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,720
at the time. And when I say boys, I mean boys. Harvard was strictly for boys. And so, and

113
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:40,880
it was about $180 a year at the time when in 1833 the average laborer is making between

114
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,320
30 and 50 cents a day. So $180, $190 a year is a lot of money. So the people that are

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,160
going to Harvard tend to be the well off people, sons of doctors, sons of lawyers. Thoreau

116
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,480
is not any of those guys, but they really insisted, mom and dad really insisted that

117
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,260
at least one of the boys go to college. Henry was sent over his brother supposedly because

118
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,720
he was a better scholar. They didn't want to waste their money, I guess. So, but you're

119
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,120
going to go to Harvard for one of four reasons. Doctor, lawyer, minister, teacher. Thoreau

120
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:23,880
became a teacher. He was 16, graduated at 20, middle of his class. He, you know, he

121
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,400
wasn't showing off. He wasn't dropping behind. He's just kind of in the middle there. But

122
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,920
he was a teacher briefly in Concord. And then he and his brother John opened their own private

123
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,600
academy for a couple of years. But by 1843 or so, they were done with that. John died

124
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,400
from from lockjaw, sadly, at the age of 26. So Thoreau's teaching career only lasted a

125
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:55,880
couple of years. By then, he had met Ralph Waldo Emerson. After he graduated in 1837,

126
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,040
he met Emerson. And really, I think that's when he decided he sees this guy who's writing

127
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,480
essays and giving lectures. And I think that's what kind of decided where he decided, well,

128
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,080
that's kind of what I want to do, too. Okay, so Emerson was a huge influence on him. Absolutely.

129
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:22,880
And he's done teaching. How does he make this transition into writing Walden? I mean, his

130
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,560
most famous, so I, you know, full disclosure, before reading the Wikipedia article yesterday,

131
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,320
I just knew the line items from high school. I knew that he had written Walden. I've been

132
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,880
to the museum. I am sort of a very, very baseline knowledge here. So he's a teacher. What happens?

133
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,280
So there's a huge difference between the Henry Thoreau that just graduated from college in

134
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,960
1837 to the guy that writes Walden in 1854. It's a, you know, like any of our lives, it's

135
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,400
a progression. And hopefully, throughout your life, you're growing a little bit more. Once

136
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,440
he decided that he was going to be a writer or a man of letters, as he says, the best

137
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,640
thing that happened to him was he was hanging out with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Okay. Emerson

138
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,520
is, Emerson was always finding young men and young women who he thought was going to be

139
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,960
the next great genius, the next great writer or poet or philosopher or whatever. And he

140
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,760
would always really tout these people and he would introduce them to each other. He

141
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,400
would introduce them to people in Cambridge, in Boston. I think that he really felt that

142
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,960
Thoreau was probably the best one out of all of those people. And he had really high hopes

143
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:45,280
for him. And in those early days, 1837, 38, 39, he's really introducing Thoreau as the

144
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,520
man of Concord. And he would say, oh, you have to meet this guy, this young friend of

145
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,640
mine. Thoreau was 14 years younger. So you have to meet this kid. You know, he's funny

146
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,120
and he's brilliant and he has these nature observations. They would go for walks and

147
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
Thoreau was pointing stuff out, the trees and the plants and the birds and the birdsong

148
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,120
and the moss. And Emerson is just completely enraptured by all of this. So he's the one

149
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,360
that kind of gets Thoreau to start keeping a journal in 1837. He says, what are you doing?

150
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,000
Why aren't you keeping a journal? So Thoreau keeps a journal because of Emerson. And that's

151
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,520
where he starts to write down his observations. Fast forward over the years, a lot of those

152
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,760
observations that he would put down in his journal eventually became his lectures and

153
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,280
his essays and even Walden in 1854.

154
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,160
That's fascinating. So I mean, this is, you know, kind of squaring this with how I think

155
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,560
about, you know, I go on walks around Concord all the time. If I'm walking with some, I

156
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,240
am not a naturalist. If I'm walking with someone who's pointing out everything as I walk through

157
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,200
the woods, I kind of zone out. I say that's really, well, this person really knows what

158
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,340
they're talking about. Emerson is one of those people who can say this is a talent that this

159
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,680
person has. This person is very engaged with nature and he helps Henry channel that into

160
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,640
something that is significant and actually can be useful in the world.

161
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,080
Absolutely. You know, I can imagine them walking through the woods and Thoreau is doing this

162
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,720
thing and pointing stuff out and Emerson saying to him, great, write it down.

163
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah. And then he would never have thought to do that before. Probably he wasn't around

164
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,840
people who knew how to capture that gift.

165
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,480
Well, and this is a good period. So the 1830s into the 1840s is a good period for people

166
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,380
like Emerson and Thoreau because you have people who are now traveling the country earning

167
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,840
a living as lecturers.

168
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Okay.

169
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,000
You know, this is something that starts in the 1820s. The Lyceum movement starts here.

170
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,840
I think it was in Medford in Massachusetts in the 1820s. The Concord Lyceum started in

171
00:14:51,840 --> 00:15:00,600
1939 and basically every winter from say October to March or April, the farmers and shopkeepers

172
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,640
of Concord would go to the first parish church or the town hall or one of the school buildings

173
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,600
and they would hear lectures. And these lectures would more often than not be from people who

174
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,600
are out of town who are traveling around the Northeast or even around the country lecturing

175
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,360
on whatever subject they're known for.

176
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,280
So you have scientists and biologists and doctors and historians and naturalists all

177
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,040
kind of coming to these small farming towns and you might not be interested in what they

178
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,280
have to say but everybody else is going to go so why not?

179
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,520
It's something to do. There are no movies to go see.

180
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Absolutely.

181
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,940
There are no concerts to go in.

182
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,640
Especially in the wintertime.

183
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,840
And that's why the Lyceum is in the winter because of the entire year the least amount

184
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,480
of work by farmers is done in the wintertime. So that's why it's being done in the winter.

185
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:00,520
So people like Emerson and others, this kind of becomes their job. Emerson had lots of

186
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,160
books published and lots of poetry published. He made much more money as a lecturer than

187
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,280
he did as an author or a writer. So this is a good time because Thoreau is seeing Emerson

188
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,240
do this and he's going to Emerson's lectures and I'm sure he's thinking, well gosh, if

189
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
he can do it, I can do it too.

190
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,600
Now the only problem is Thoreau hated lecturing. He was not a big fan of it.

191
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,480
Why? Did he not like public speaking?

192
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,960
By all accounts from what we understand he was really bad at it.

193
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,920
He tended, now these are the days before microphones of course, he wasn't very good at enunciating

194
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,320
very loudly. We understand that he would often hold his lecture and he always read his lecture

195
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,800
just as Emerson did. He would hold it up really close to his face and if you're sitting at

196
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,080
First Parish Church and you're in the back row and this guy's up front and he's reading

197
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,920
into his papers, you're not going to hear very much. He's not very demonstrative. Some

198
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,480
of these orators of the day, people like Henry Clay and others, Henry Ward Beecher, the famous

199
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,840
preacher from New York, they were very demonstrative.

200
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Performers.

201
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,000
Absolutely. Emerson was kind of a performer although from what we understand he had very

202
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,480
forceful voice but he wasn't particularly active while he was speaking.

203
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Because he was reading it.

204
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Exactly.

205
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
That's a big difference.

206
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,080
But he would raise his hand or he would punch his hand into his fist or pound his hand onto

207
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,920
the lectern or something like that. Thoreau was not really doing any of that stuff and

208
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,960
he was probably socially awkward in a lot of ways from what we understand. He didn't

209
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,120
really like being around people. If he had something that he felt that he needed to say,

210
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,520
he had no trouble lecturing on it. And also like Emerson, he would try out some of his

211
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,140
stuff in front of a live audience just to see if it worked or not. The first chapter

212
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,540
of Walden actually started as a lecture and he lectured it and gave the lecture a bunch

213
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,360
of times, not only here but other places. So he's seeing how it worked but he's not

214
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,080
particularly crazy about being in front of the people.

215
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,320
Yeah. So some of these people who are falling asleep in the back of the first parish church

216
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,000
during his lectures would be probably shocked that we are talking about him in 2024 as a

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,440
prominent figure in Concord history.

218
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,040
We actually have there is a guy, I think it was in Lincoln, the town of Lincoln might

219
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,320
have been or some other town around here. Thoreau was reading his essay Walking, which

220
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:39,040
from 1850 to 57 or so, 59, Thoreau gave that lecture more than any other. And he would

221
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,780
see what worked and what didn't work and eventually it was published after he died. But today

222
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,520
Walking is considered one of Thoreau's, one of his big hits. Everybody loves the essay.

223
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,800
A guy, a young man went to see him read Walking and he says in his journal that he fell asleep

224
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,680
during it. So yeah, people were falling asleep. So Thoreau would lecture when he had to but

225
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,360
he was not crazy about it. And he didn't want to be famous. Emerson was always trying to

226
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,120
get this guy to be famous. And Thoreau in his lifetime really had no interest in that.

227
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Sure.

228
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,440
Again, a lot of it is because he wants to do his own thing. He wants to be by himself.

229
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,960
He likes his solitude. He's much happier going for his walks every day in the woods. He's

230
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,280
much happier hanging out with his family. And he and his family were incredibly close.

231
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,240
Yeah. So that's something I was wondering. You know, you mentioned his brother passing

232
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,280
at 26 years old. I have to imagine if he's that close to his family that has to affect

233
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,240
him and his work and his day to day life.

234
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:51,060
Yeah. So John was the first one of the family to pass away in January of 1842. And it really

235
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:59,280
shook Thoreau greatly. He and John were the best of friends. The famous trip they took

236
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,360
was in 1839. They built their own rowboat. They rode from Concord, Massachusetts to Concord,

237
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,080
New Hampshire and then walked to the White Mountains from there. It was a 13 day excursion.

238
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,720
After John dies, a couple of years later, Thoreau moves to Walden Pond. He's writing

239
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,280
his first book. That book is A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers about that boating

240
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:28,040
trip. So it had a huge impact on Thoreau in the sense that his first book is completely

241
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,000
dedicated to his brother John. It bombed when it was published, but that's a whole other

242
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,640
story. But then Helen dies. Helen Thoreau dies in 1849 from tuberculosis. So really,

243
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,200
after 1850, it's Henry and his sister Sophia and their mom and dad. And Henry and his sister

244
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,520
Sophia were incredibly close. And she was absolutely brilliant in her own way. She was

245
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,160
an incredible botanist. And after he dies in 1862, she becomes his literary executor

246
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,320
and books like Cape Cod and Maine Woods are published because of Sophia.

247
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,720
Got it. So you talk about him sort of seeking this isolation and kind of being away from

248
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,040
people. He obviously achieves that at Walden Pond. Can you talk a bit about how that when

249
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,960
that happens, how that happens, what the process was for him there and going deep into the

250
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
woods? He had been thinking about it for quite some

251
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,680
time. When he was at Harvard, one of his classmates, Charles Stearns Wheeler, actually built a

252
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:47,680
small cabin over near one of the ponds here in Lincoln or next door in Lincoln and Thoreau.

253
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,680
And he spent the summer there. And so that kind of stuck with Thoreau. And after he graduated

254
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:03,640
from Harvard, moves back to Concord, he meets Emerson as early as like 1840, 1839. Thoreau's

255
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,040
writing in his journal. I want to find a place where I can live by myself and do my writing.

256
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:16,840
He's living at mom and dad's house and dad's making pencils with help. He has a couple

257
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,880
of Irish boys and mom is keeping borders. And it's not really the most conducive place

258
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,900
for writing. So he needs to find a Garrett of some sort or a writer's retreat. So Emerson

259
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:35,400
buys some property over at Walden Pond in the fall of 1844. And everybody knew about

260
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,040
Thoreau's wishes, his family, his friends. And so Emerson basically says, I've got this

261
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,680
land. You want to go out there? And Thoreau says, sure. And that's what led to it. Again,

262
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,400
it would not have happened without Ralph Waldo Emerson.

263
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,860
Wow. Right. Sort of the patron saint of...

264
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,800
He was the patron saint of everybody. He gave Henry money and jobs. He gave the Alcotts

265
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:07,080
money and jobs. Emerson was pretty successful and pretty well off. He also inherited a lot

266
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,840
of money from his first wife when she died. So he was pretty comfortable and he had absolutely

267
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,600
no problem with sharing his money with people who he thought needed it, like Thoreau or

268
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,520
the Alcotts. So because of Emerson, Thoreau's living at Walden Pond. He builds his house.

269
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,720
He's there for a lot of reasons. He's there to write his first book. He's there to simplify

270
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:38,320
his life. He really wants to kind of... After a lot of people graduate from college, we

271
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,440
do stuff like we travel Europe or we go backpacking across country. When I graduated, I went to

272
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,800
New York for two years. I think that even though it's a few years after college, the

273
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,400
two years at Walden Pond was kind of like Thoreau's growing up and discovering himself,

274
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,720
period. The Henry Thoreau of 1844 is completely different in my mind from the Henry Thoreau

275
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,240
of 1848 when he's done living at Walden Pond. He becomes a much better writer. He becomes

276
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,480
a much better observer of nature. He becomes much better at science, figuring out why stuff

277
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:25,160
works, why do the trees do this? So just the Henry Thoreau that we know now and who we

278
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,640
honor and who we're talking about, he became that Henry Thoreau while living at Walden

279
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Pond.

280
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,680
Yeah. Yeah. It sounded like, too, I mean, well, for one, he went to college young, 16,

281
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,360
and he probably didn't really fit in with a lot of his classmates. So he probably didn't

282
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,960
really discover himself at college. And in fact, I saw a story about how to get his diploma

283
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,400
from Harvard, they were going to charge him $5 for the... And he refused to pay it because

284
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,600
he said the sheep can keep their skins.

285
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Right. That's the way it worked out.

286
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,400
He didn't sound super impressed with his experience in college.

287
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,360
Yeah. So he received his bachelor, what was called a bachelor of arts degree. And again,

288
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,800
he was a doctor, lawyer, minister, or teacher. Back then, a few years, I think it was like

289
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,160
five years after you graduate, if you're still around and you're still alive and you pay

290
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:27,000
Harvard $5, you get your master's degree, which it was still that easy, right? And so,

291
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,480
and he thought, well, no, I didn't do anything for it. Just the fact that I'm still around

292
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,680
and I paid my $5. So that's exactly what he did.

293
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
He saw it as a money grab.

294
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:43,920
Yeah, that's exactly what it was. And he was not a proud Harvard graduate. He said that

295
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,960
he learned more in the two years that he lived at Walden Pond than the four years that he

296
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,320
wasted in Cambridge. The famous story is Emerson, also a Harvard graduate, was very proud of

297
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,120
being a Harvard graduate. And he said that Harvard teaches all of the branches of education,

298
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:10,280
to which Thurlow replied, yes, but none of the roots. So he kind of thought that Harvard

299
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,200
was a waste of his time. The only reason he went was because he was 16 and mom and dad

300
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
said, you're going to Harvard.

301
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Yeah.

302
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
And yeah.

303
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Okay, well, yeah, I'm 16.

304
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Sure went out.

305
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Yeah.

306
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,940
He hated being in Cambridge. He would walk home many weekends from Cambridge to Concord.

307
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,720
He preferred being in Concord. Yeah, he would go to Cambridge even as he got older in life.

308
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,680
He wouldn't go to Cambridge or Boston all that often. He would go occasionally, but

309
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:45,080
he preferred as he'd say, I usually leave cities more willingly than I go into them.

310
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,520
So he just didn't really like big places.

311
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,740
So you mentioned a lot of these works that, you know, he's a few people are falling asleep

312
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:58,840
at his lectures, his books bomb when they're released. He's obviously very famous now.

313
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,680
Did any of that hit while he was still alive or is most of it posthumous?

314
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:11,160
That's well, the fame is definitely after he died. Yeah, absolutely. He dies in 1862,

315
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:18,000
May 6th, 1862 at the age of 44. He'd only had two books published. He'd only lectured

316
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,560
seventy five times and he'd had a handful of essays published in various periodicals.

317
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:33,080
He's just beginning to maybe be famous when he dies in 1862. Not too long before he died,

318
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:40,320
Bronson Alcott actually wrote an article for the Atlantic called The Forester about Thurow.

319
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,920
And Emerson was even in later years, Emerson was still kind of trying to push him and Walden

320
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,200
did OK. The first book bombed horribly. Walden did OK when it was published in 1854, but

321
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,560
it took him five years to sell out those two thousand copies, you know, compared to something

322
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,000
like Uncle Tom's Cabin. I think in the first six months, Uncle Tom's Cabin did something

323
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,480
like five hundred thousand copies, I mean, some outrageous amount. So Thurow is really

324
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,360
under the literary radar. He's not as famous as Emerson. He's not as famous as Hawthorne.

325
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,720
And so that's kind of starting. But in 1862, when he dies, he's actually becoming better

326
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:28,720
known as a naturalist than as a writer or as a transcendentalist or an abolitionist.

327
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,880
As I said earlier, because of his sister, Sophia, The Maine Woods was published, Cape

328
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,040
Cod was published. They published a book called Excursions, which is a bunch of his travel

329
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:45,080
essays. So his publisher, Tickner and Fields and his sister, they really kind of keep his

330
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,920
name alive in the 1860s going into the 1870s. But, you know, if you go to the Boston Public

331
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,360
Library, you walk into the one section and up on the ceiling, there are all these names.

332
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,060
There's Emerson and there's Longfellow and Whittier and Hawthorne and even people like

333
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:10,800
Francis Parkman, the historian, but there's no Thurow up there. So this area, Concord,

334
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:18,380
Boston, Massachusetts, he's not really on anybody's on anybody's list of the great

335
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:27,280
writers. A friend of his, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, abolitionist and writer, he actually

336
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,320
thought, well, maybe we should try to get Thurow's journals published. And so he came

337
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,680
to the Concord to talk to Sophia about getting them published. And he went to a couple of

338
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,720
people who had money. And one of the people he asked said, well, the main question is,

339
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,600
why would anybody want to read Thurow's journals? Who cares? So that didn't happen until like

340
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,600
1906. But it's really the late 19th century. Leo Tolstoy read him and thought, why aren't

341
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:04,760
Americans reading this guy? 1906, a guy named Mohandas Gandhi read Civil Disobedience and

342
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,760
said, oh, I'm doing this in South Africa. This is what I'm doing. So it's really the

343
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,440
early 20th century that Thurow's kind of starting to gain fame, at least in America. By the

344
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,480
1950s, you have people like Jack Kerouac talking about him and reading him. Supposedly, when

345
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,760
Kerouac went on the road, he took, I think he took a week on the Concord and Merrimack

346
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:37,920
Rivers with him, maybe Walden. In fact, Kerouac said that he wanted to be a Thurow of the

347
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,840
mountains. So you've got people like him. And then in the 1960s, the counterculture,

348
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,360
the hippies all discovered him and kind of made him the poster child. Thurow protested

349
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,280
the Mexican War. The hippies are protesting the Vietnam War. The environmental movements

350
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:03,360
really starting in the 1960s, 1972 with, of all people, President Nixon creates or helps

351
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,720
signs the EPA into existence. The environmental movement really kind of adopted Thurow as

352
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,480
the poster child of environmentalism. So it's really in 1960s. So about 100 years and then

353
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,840
1962 was the centennial of his death. So that's really when he kind of started to become famous.

354
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:28,440
So he was just way, way, way ahead of his time. I mean, you know, I think a lot of the

355
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,920
concepts that he brings up really resonate today and are very important. I mean, just

356
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,840
the site, certainly the concept of engaging with nature, you know, put your, put your

357
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,800
phone away, get out of the house, see what this world has to offer. He was a big advocate

358
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,680
of minimalist living, getting rid of stuff. Right. Well, I think that's, that's why he

359
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,800
resonates so much. I mean, here it is 2024 and we're talking about this guy. I think

360
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,200
that when you go to high school, they all get lumped together. So you have to read Emerson,

361
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,680
you have to read Thurow, you have to read Moby Dick, you have to read the Scarlet Letter.

362
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,120
And frankly, a lot of kids that I meet, they don't really care about any of that stuff.

363
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,000
It's pretty glossed over. At least it wasn't my high school experience. I went to Catholic

364
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,720
school so we didn't read any of this stuff. I think we read Moby Dick or at least parts

365
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,160
of it. But anyway, so, but Thurow to a lot of younger readers and even a lot of older

366
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,920
readers, he seems, he seems more now. His language isn't as archaic as Emerson. It's

367
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,360
certainly not as archaic as somebody like Benjamin Franklin or George Washington or

368
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,600
any of those people from the 18th century. His works seem modern to us. And I think that's

369
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,840
why people are still relating and reacting to him because he's writing about stuff that

370
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,200
we can relate to. Like you said, you know, the minimalist thing, getting rid of stuff

371
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,520
and the connection with nature, especially now with the, with the green movement and

372
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,160
the climate change concerns. He's, he's speaking to all of that stuff in the 1850s.

373
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:16,480
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would say at least from my observation in town here, having met high

374
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,440
school students through the neighborhood or through some of the stuff that I do through,

375
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,840
through the college interview process, students are very environmentally conscious in this

376
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,720
town and I'm impressed by it. I mean, and socially aware. So I've been very impressed

377
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,880
with whatever curriculum they have going on at the high school. It's going to be a few

378
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,760
years before I found out my son's in kindergarten currently, but it's been, it's been pretty

379
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
impressive to meet these students. And you know, it gives me good hope for the next generations

380
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,880
won't, won't screw stuff up as much as ours and previous ones have.

381
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,120
Well, I, and you know, I do living history as thorough over at Walden Pond. So I meet

382
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,760
school groups from all over the country and it's a lot of the younger generation. I feel

383
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,000
like high school kids are way more progressive than we were when we were in high school.

384
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
I never thought about that stuff. I never was, never came across my radar.

385
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,520
No, same here. Same here. Plus, you know, I grew up in a Republican household,

386
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,160
but, but you're right. And so I meet high school and college kids and they care about the

387
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:30,880
environment. They care about black lives matter. They care about, about LGBTQ rights. I mean,

388
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,360
and to them it's all just natural stuff. Natural. It's not, it's not controversial.

389
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,120
It's not, it's, it's not what someone would call woke. It's just life.

390
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,800
Right. You know, it's almost like they're like, well, why, why wouldn't gay people have equal

391
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,480
rights? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So that's, that's why I'd say I've, I've been very impressed. So

392
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,080
uh, kudos to Cochran and it sounds like local school groups from all over the place.

393
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,800
Absolutely. I think that, you know, and so I think that's why Tharo really resonates with a lot of

394
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,760
people when, when younger people find out that he went to jail for not paying his poll tax, or if

395
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,200
younger people find out that he was helping people on the underground railroad, um, you know, cause

396
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,400
he's, let's face it, he's got kind of a bad rap for being this lone guy living in a house.

397
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,040
Living in a cabin by himself in Walden woods, you know, but then you say, well, no, actually he helped

398
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,760
run away slaves. Oh no, wait, he actually protested the Mexican war and went to jail for not paying his

399
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,760
poll tax. You know, when kids realize that or hear about that, they realize that there's more to this

400
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,640
guy than, than, than they've heard before. Yeah. No, it's interesting to me just thinking about,

401
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,560
um, this guy who was notorious for burying his face in the paper when he gave lectures is actually

402
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:52,160
one who was most aware of everything around him in the world. And he's not making a big thing about

403
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,920
it. One thing that bothered him more than anything else was somebody say an abolitionist who would do

404
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,320
something like hide a runaway slave or, or, or make an antislavery speech and then walk around bragging

405
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,200
about how he had done it. Yeah. When Tharo went to jail for not paying his poll tax, he didn't tell

406
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,880
anybody until like the next day. And he mentioned it to Bronson Alcott. Um, he probably mentioned it

407
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,680
to his family, but they were abolitionists. So they probably thought it was okay. He's not going

408
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:27,680
around making a big deal about it. It's not till three years later that, that civil disobedience

409
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,080
called resistance to civil government was actually published and people had to kind of push him and

410
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,360
say, you know, you should write about this. And he gave a lecture on it. So he's not blowing his own

411
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:44,720
horn. He's kind of letting his work and his actions speak for themselves. Yeah. Um, at a time when,

412
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,560
you know, we're living, he's living in a world with people like P.T. Barnum who are blowing their own

413
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,960
horn all the time. Yeah. And Tharo just doesn't want to be a part of that. He's going to do his

414
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,600
thing. Why is he going to do his thing? Because it's the right thing to do. And I think younger

415
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,040
people, well, that's why the counterculture was attracted to him in the 1960s and the, the beat

416
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:12,000
writers, you know, he's always been really popular with the folks who follow, follow their own drummer.

417
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Sure. To, to coin a phrase by Henry. So yeah, so the beat writers, they see him doing his own thing.

418
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,520
The hippies see him doing his own thing. I first got into him back in the 80s when I was singing in

419
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,520
punk bands and I found a copy of civil disobedience in a punk rock record store. So, so, you know, so

420
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,000
it's always the, the, the, as Kerouac would say, the misfits who are, who are Indian. When I'm,

421
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,040
when I'm talking to a group of school kids, if I've got 50 kids in front of me and one of the kids

422
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,120
has, has green hair or, or a nose piercing, I can bet you a thousand dollars. Yeah, you're talking

423
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,040
to them. That's the kid that's going to come up to me later. Yeah. And it happens all the time.

424
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,120
That's fascinating. Yeah. Well, this has been incredible. You know, hopefully we can get you

425
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,080
back for another story down the line. Absolutely. Thank you so much for joining. I hope, I hope this

426
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,800
is the highlight of your career to be on season one, episode one. You know, I can retire happy now.

427
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,440
This is what I've always wanted to do. Awesome. Well, thank you, Richard Smith. You know, anyone

428
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,600
listening, where, where, where can we find you in town? I'm usually, I work a couple of days a week

434
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:02,320
My pleasure. My pleasure.
